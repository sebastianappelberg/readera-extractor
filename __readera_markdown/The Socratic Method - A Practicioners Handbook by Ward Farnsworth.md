*Those who mean to push back against the corrosion of our thought and discourse on every front and without partisanship can helpfully say, before they identify by party, that they are Socratics; before they take up arms, they can subscribe to Socratic rules of engagement. This book explains what that commitment might mean.*

**Taking on a certain mindset can change you into someone great. This applies not only to the individual but the mindset of the group as well.

*Great geniuses have the shortest biographies. Their cousins can tell you nothing about them. They lived in their writings, and so their house and street life was trivial and commonplace. If you would know their tastes and complexions, the most admiring of their readers most resembles them. Plato, especially, has no external biography. If he had lover, wife, or children, we hear nothing of them. He ground them all into paint. As a good chimney burns its smoke, so a philosopher converts the value of all his fortunes into his intellectual performances.6*

**Great geniuses don't give a fuck about anything other than what they're geniuses at.

*In the natural process of growth in the human mind, belief does not follow proof, but springs up apart from and independent of it;
an immature intelligence believes first, and proves (if indeed it ever seeks proof) afterwards.*

**What David Deutsch would say to this is, yes of course the beliefs come first. Everything starts with a conjecture. Then error correction must follow.

*The enemy against whom Plato really fought, and the warfare against whom was the incessant occupation of the greater part of his life and writings, was not Sophistry, either in the ancient or the modern sense of the term, but Commonplace. It was the acceptance of traditional opinions and current sentiments as an ultimate fact; and bandying of the abstract terms which express approbation and disapprobation, desire and aversion, admiration and disgust, as if they had a meaning thoroughly understood and universally assented to.*

**He is talking about seeing through the Matrix. I wonder if his psychedelic journeys helped with that.

Page: 33

*Mill’s comments assign the Socratic method a purpose that has, from a certain point of view, as much to do with cognitive psychology as with philosophy. Our minds stumble and exaggerate and lie; they fool us and are fooled. We think and talk in certainties that feel solid but have nothing much behind them. The Socratic method is a corrective. It exposes this state of affairs and helps us build something humbler and stronger.*

**If it's an antidote to simplistic, black and white thinking then I'm in.

---
Page: 36

*But that can’t quite be right, can it? Some people show courage while running away from an enemy. You need a definition that covers them, too.*

**Thinking of edge cases that disqualified the explanation. 

---
Page: 37

*It’s like defining speed. Speed can be shown in lots of settings—when someone is speaking or running or making music on a lyre. So we might say that speed generally means the ability to get a lot done in a short time. Courage is a quality, like speed.
Can you describe it in a general way that is comparable?*

**Finding the least common denominator of a concept. Something that generalize well.

---
Page: 37

*But you said that courage is admirable. So our definition seems wrong: it makes courage sometimes sound bad, but it’s good.*

**Checking for inconsistencies and contradictions.

---
Page: 38

*You can’t mean just any sort of knowledge. Which kind?*

**Questioning if the generalization made is valid?

---
Page: 39

*But people who have that knowledge would have more than courage. Since they understand the true nature of what is good and what is evil, they would also be just and pious; indeed, it’s hard to think of a virtue they wouldn’t have, isn’t it?
NICIAS. So it would seem.
SOCRATES. Yet we said that courage was just one kind of virtue. Now we’ve defined it in a way that covers too much. We’ve turned courage into a form of knowledge that doesn’t make it distinctive from other virtues. So I’m worried that we still haven’t figured out exactly what courage is.*

**Reframing the concept based on what has been learned in the conversation. 

---
Page: 41

*Here is the Socratic method in crude form: When someone makes a claim about right and wrong or good and bad, question it. Ask what the claim means, and about other things its holder believes, and look for tension between those points; show with your questions that the claim must in some way be unsatisfactory to the person who made it. In effect you deny what your discussion partners say, but the denial is artful. If you do this right, it won’t even sound like an argument. They will refine their claims, and now you do it again.*

**When do you know when you've reached a good conclusion or explanation? 

---
Page: 41

*If someone has a talent for denying your claims (hopefully with some indirection and tact), you might change your mind for the better.*

**I want an AI that does this for me.

---
Page: 42

*Asking good Socratic questions takes ingenuity, especially when it comes to spotting Y—the thing you believe, perhaps deep down, that is inconsistent with whatever you’ve just said. Sometimes Y has to be drawn out with hypothetical questions that you hadn’t thought about before. It also takes stamina to keep answering such questions when they get uneasy.*

**How do you come up with statements that would be inconsistent with your previous statements? And how does one ask one self tough questions? 

---
Page: 44

*The most important feature of a dialogue, when seen in this way, isn’t whether its arguments are finally persuasive. The most important feature is the effect that the dialogue has on the reader. Sometimes arguments that fail, or that refute one another, help an audience toward a certain understanding or frame of mind. That frame of mind may be more valuable than being persuaded of this proposition or that one. The frame of mind may be a new perspective from which it is apparent that all the propositions in the dialogue are inadequate. It may be a perspective from which the chase after the truth is seen to be the highest human pursuit even if (or perhaps because) the complete capture of that truth is not possible. A reader sometimes is brought to such a perspective more effectively by taking part in an exhausting and failed chase rather than by being told to adopt the perspective directly.4*

**Showing instead of telling. Who cares about the author thinks? What matters is what the reader feels. 

---
Page: 46

*You’re being Socratic when you press skeptically against easy answers, go many questions deep, and are mindful of your ignorance. These aren’t modest aims; they change the way one responds to everything. Seeing them acted out in dialogues is a good way to learn about their value, but that value isn’t found principally in dialogues that we rarely conduct. It is found in the way we think about problems every day.*

**It's a shift in mindset, which is like upgrading your mental operating system. It can change have you perceive the world and shape that your consciousness takes.

---
Page: 49

*As a discussion which the mind has with itself about whatever it is investigating. Now, I’m not making this assertion as an expert: it’s just that the image I get of thinking is that the mind is simply carrying on a conversation: it asks itself questions and answers them, saying yes or no. And when it reaches a conclusion (which may take quite a long time or may involve a sudden leap), stops being divided and starts to affirm something consistently, we call this its belief. So I call a belief a statement, but one which is not made aloud to someone else, but in silence to oneself.*

**What about thoughts and feelings that cannot be expressed in language? 

---
Page: 50

*Socrates goes on to recount his questioner’s tactics: if I say this, he’ll say that; if I say something else, he’ll laugh at me. “He stops at nothing, and he never accepts anything easily” (289e). The types of arguments the questioner uses against Socrates are the same kind that Socrates uses against others. They’re just a little more brutal.*

**Personifying parts of your mind is a great way to introspect. To do metacognition. 

---
Page: 51

*Questions and answers are the sound of thought happening. An essay or lecture is usually the sound of thought having happened, then polished up so the result is clear and the process of getting there is no longer visible.*

**Externalizing your inner dialogue is a good way to dispassionately evaluate your own thinking process.

---
Page: 54

*And Socratic questioning is like physical exercise in an additional sense: it’s good for you, but doesn’t feel good when you’re doing it; in fact it’s often good for you just to the extent that it’s uncomfortable. That is why nothing is more common than intellectual obesity.*

**I want to push myself to intellectual exhaustion, just to feel what it's like.

---
Page: 58

*The practitioner of the Socratic method thinks in questions, is at home with uncertainty, and knows how to value a search that doesn’t end.*

**Building product is a little bit like this. It's about continuously solving a user's problems. It's an infinite game.

---
Page: 59

*That is why the philosophy of Socrates mostly isn’t a set of beliefs. It’s an activity. The Socratic method doesn’t replace your current opinions with better ones. It changes your relationship to your opinions. It replaces the love of holding them with the love of testing them.*

**Every branch of knowledge stretches infinitely. We will never have the final answer for anything. A philosophy that makes claims on anything is suspect. 

---
Page: 59

*The Socratic approach means fewer declarations and more questions, and especially questions about things presupposed in those other kinds of thoughts. When you think and talk in declarations, you aren’t learning anything. When you think and talk in questions, you might be.
Someone says something you hate; instead of saying you hate it, you ask questions. What does it mean? Is it consistent? What’s a good comparison?
You say something they hate. Instead of defending it, you ask questions.
(What did you mean by it?) You give up some of the pleasures of holding strong opinions, and in return the ones you do hold are better founded.*

**I have a tendency to have very strong opinions about stuff. I don't know why. 

---
Page: 60

*Every time you ask and answer good questions, your understanding gets a bit deeper. You better understand the other side and the weaknesses on your side. You see more complexity. To the extent that you’re Socratic in outlook, you like all this. And conversely you aren’t very interested in hearing quick reactions from others—reactions, at least, to anything that matters—because those opinions are worth so little. They are one ply deep.*

**Digging deeper require time and effort but it's always more rewarding. This is true not only for knowledge but deepening relationships too.

---
Page: 62

*The slow pacing of Socratic questions has a further attraction. Socrates tells us that he’s interested in the care of the psyche—his own, and that of his partner in dialogue, and (inevitably, though it is not said) the reader’s.
The care might mean operating the mind at a certain speed. The pacing of the dialogues is an implied argument about this—that is, about the optimal pace of speech and thought. A different kind of pace creates a different kind of person. Socrates displays a sense of equanimity on all occasions, and the slow rhythm of his approach is part of that. He’s never in a rush.*

**The same way that rushed, bundled up code changes make for a risky mess, so does rushing thought and skipping steps reduce your chances of deeper understanding. 

---
Page: 64

*They’re half-conscious ideas that we take for granted and that are kept out of view.
Socratic questioning takes off the camouflage. A belief that had seemed too obvious or sacred to get grilled is put on the stand. For as long as the questioning lasts, the belief isn’t so much a part of you. It had been talking through you; now you are talking to it. Adversarial thinking separates us from our prejudices and expectations.*

**Confirmation biases in different forms may be the most deceptive form of hiding truth.

---
Page: 63

*Leading questions have their downside. The asker does all the thinking;
the witness just confirms or denies. Sometimes that isn’t what you want.
You want to find out what the witness thinks. In that case you use direct examination rather than cross-examination. No leading questions are allowed; you have to let the witness talk freely and answer the question in whatever way seems best. Cross-examination has its place after those answers are on the table. That’s how Socrates does it: he takes his time and asks easy questions until he understands exactly what is being said. Then comes the cross.*

**Leading questions are to be saved for the end. 

---
Page: 66

*Socratic questioning gives you a more intelligent understanding of a subject. It makes you reach conclusions more slowly and puts a brake on many kinds of foolishness. But in return you give up the satisfaction of easily knowing what you think and usually feeling certain that you are right. This is the Socratic trade, and it involves a risk. Instead of being sure of too much, you might be sure of too little. In deciding which error is better to risk, you might reflect on which erroneous parties tend to cause more harm or do more good: those who claim to have all the answers or those who don’t make that claim. Perhaps you can think of examples either way. Historically speaking, however, I will venture that the more skeptical ones tend to come off well in that accounting.*

**This may lead to analysis paralysis which is a problem if you're in a time constrained environment and you need to make decisions.

---
Page: 70

*Notice that Socrates uses questions to get the agreement of his partner at every step. Didn’t you say this, and don’t you also think that—and don’t they conflict? This matters because it means, when the final result arrives, that Laches has contradicted himself rather than being contradicted by Socrates. He has full ownership of the problem.*

**I guess it's not nice to trap other people like this but doing it to yourself would be masterful. 

---
Page: 71

*Shame can also enter Socratic questioning as a reaction to your own inconsistency.8 This kind of shame doesn’t depend on time and place or whether the community is rational. It’s the discomfort of realizing that you don’t know what you’re talking about or that you were sure when you shouldn’t have been. It’s a homemade form of shame, strictly between you and yourself, so it can be felt identically by people thousands of years apart in radically different situations. It’s a sign that you are making progress.*

**When I make weak justification for things just to protect myself from needing to take action, I feel a special kind of shame. 

---
Page: 73

*So the Socratic method isn’t just a way to show that big claims made by others (or yourself) always tend to fall apart in the end, though that is one tendency of it. The method can be a way to defend an idea. Or the elenchus can be used to test an interpretation of something—the words of an oracle then, or a text now. Deny it and watch what happens.*

**Flexible tools work on good first principles. 

---
Page: 75

*As a proposition holds up under different conditions, confidence in it rises. The elenchus thus becomes a device for finding truth, not just refuting what others say. It can produce cumulative consistency.
Cumulative consistency is more than reassuring. It leads to enlargement of your knowledge and confidence in it; it snowballs. In this way the elenchus helps along the formation of the self. It causes you to figure out what your moral conscience is made of. There is a conflict in your views;
you have to decide which to keep and which to drop. It is like an inner tournament with winning and losing ideas. You understand yourself better after many rounds of it.17 The Socratic method thus helps toward fulfillment of the instruction inscribed over the entrance to the Temple of Apollo at Delphi: know thyself.*

**Popper would have probably agreed with this. The tournament analogy is interesting, is it as simple as two opposing ideas competing and having the other one be discarded? Or is it more like Pokémon, where one idea might be beaten by an idea that lost to an idea that itself had beaten? Are rematches allowed? 

**I have a great deal of internal conflict that is making itself more or less heard depending on my mood. On good days I'm able to put a lid on it. 

---
Page: 76

*CRATYLUS. You have a clear proof that he has not missed the truth, and the proof is—that he is perfectly consistent. Did you ever observe in speaking that all the words which you utter have a common character and purpose?
SOCRATES. But that, friend Cratylus, is no answer. For if he did begin in error, he may have forced the remainder into agreement with the original error and with himself; there would be nothing strange in this, any more than in geometrical diagrams, which have often a slight and invisible flaw in the first part of the process, and are consistently mistaken in the long deductions which follow. And this is the reason why every man should expend his chief thought and attention on the consideration of his first principles:—are they or are they not rightly laid down? and when he has duly sifted them, all the rest will follow.*

**We can build consistent worldviews that are utter bullshit. If our axioms are wrong, everything built on top of it is wrong. How does one get down to one's own first principles? Your own foundation.

---
Page: 78

*The best compensation—that is, the best way to make Socratic scrutiny of the self endurable—is an attitude of acceptance and good humor toward your own constant state of error. The previous section of this chapter suggested that such an attitude makes it easier for others to put up with us.
But it also makes finding the truth easier because you aren’t so desperately attached to your own views. You get used to the idea not only of being wrong a lot but of being wrong more often than you think (that’s something else that you’re wrong about). This makes it a little less agonizing to dig out the next example.*

**It's a kind of acceptance, a kind of surrender, a kind of letting go. 

---
Page: 77

*Elenctic thinking amounts to a search for contradictions between what you’re saying now and other things you believe. That is an inquiry that can be made anytime. You take your own beliefs and follow their implications as far as you can, and keep going after you flinch. You test them with extreme cases; you look at them from different perspectives; you imagine what you would think about your view if the winners and losers produced by it were reversed; and so on, with other kinds of questions we will see in chapter 18 and elsewhere.
Asking these questions of yourself is hard to do effectively. We all have blind spots and are good at persuading ourselves that we don’t; our inconsistencies are glaring to others but not to us. People who are clever imagine that they are better than others at avoiding this hazard, but they probably have the worst of it. Their ingenuity allows them to find easy ways to make their views look harmonious to themselves.*

**How does one call out bullshit in himself? How does one recruit others to do it as well? 

---
Page: 81

*The Socratic method, in its classic form, consists of internal critique. It tests whether you’re being consistent with yourself and believe all that you think you do. Socrates doesn’t tell you that you’re wrong; he shows you that you think you’re wrong. This explains the value of the frequent stops Socrates makes to get his partner to say, “Agreed.” Those pauses might seem pointless, but they aren’t, because his eventual goal is to show that his partner doesn’t agree with himself.*

**Letting the partner come to his own conclusions is a more visceral form of persuasion than flexing your own ideas.

---
Page: 83

*But now we should qualify the claim that inconsistency amounts to sure error. First, it’s a claim about propositions that are inconsistent. Sometimes inconsistencies of other kinds can survive without trouble, which is usually to say that they might not really be inconsistencies after all. It’s entirely possible, for example, for two policies to seem inconsistent but be rationally favored by the same person. Together the policies might represent a reasoned compromise between different interests. Second, consistent claims (or any other claims) may not be necessary to support a given view.
Sometimes—maybe often—we might hold moral beliefs on grounds that owe nothing to reason at all. Socrates naturally would have questions about those beliefs and whether you are sure that they’re on strong enough footing, but at times he himself claims to take guidance from god and from some sort of divine voice within.2 That isn’t the problem we’re talking about now, either.*

**The duality of man becomes an interesting topic. A good and loving father is a good man. But that same man did horrible things in war or when he was a child or when he was angry. Is the man good or bad?

---
Page: 85

*SOCRATES. If you leave it unrefuted, then I swear to you by the divine dog of the Egyptians that it’ll cause friction between you and Callicles, Callicles; there’ll be discord within you your whole life.
And yet, my friend, in my opinion it’s preferable for me to be a musician with an out-of-tune lyre or a choir leader with a cacophonous choir, and it’s preferable for almost everyone in the world to find my beliefs misguided and wrong, rather than for just one person—me—to contradict and clash with myself.*

**Being true to yourself and having honestly examined your own beliefs is more important than what anyone else thinks of you. Great artists are like this. It's important to note though that it's not the same thing as being narcissistic and immune to critique. It's more about how gross it is to be internally inconsistent, because then you are worse than stuck in the matrix, you are actively making things worse.

---
Page: 85

*Is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person; in the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to himself and the just?*

**I feel this with Kasta, it's a project that started from a lie and that's driven in ways that oppose what I think is right. 

---
Page: 86

*The threat posed to the self by inconsistency should not be viewed as an obscure philosophical problem. For many people it is immediate and pressing. They live their lives in ways that are inconsistent—out of harmony, as it were—with their deeper beliefs, whatever those might be.
They come to feel lost, stuck, or otherwise miserable. They wonder why.
Socrates would regard those results as natural and easy to understand. But it is also true that Socrates sees a problem in such a case even if it isn’t felt in full by the person who has it. In some ways the problem then is worse. It is a horrifying state that resembles dementia. We will spend more time on this point in chapter 14. Either way, though, make no mistake: taking consistency more seriously—not just in theory but actually doing it—can be very affecting: constructive and revelatory, disruptive and painful. The engine of Socratic inquiry, once fully engaged, does not leave things where it finds them.*

**Is being too consistent dangerous? Socrates himself was killed for it. He ticked off the wrong people, presumably portraying parts of the self, and was sentenced to death for it. Is the moral of the story that he did the right thing, and that even if his existence came under threat it's better to stand up for the truth than not to?

---
Page: 87

*That argument might not seem impressive now, but it displays one type of response to an inconsistency: it may be explained on terms not yet fully worked out. This prospect can sometimes make it rational to persist for a while in holding two beliefs that seem to conflict, especially when the belief under challenge has the sanction of long and seemingly successful usage.*

**This is what's necessary for creative sparks. You hold two conflicting viewpoints in your head at the same time and then you integrate them, you find a third viewpoint that resolves the inconsistency. 

---
Page: 89

*That is because it is so easy to think of philosophical questions as the kind most people can do without in their ordinary lives. A lot of academic work now described as philosophy does fit that description. But on a Socratic view, philosophy is relevant to just about everything, high and low. It isn’t a set of problems that some care about and some don’t. Philosophy means thinking carefully about whether you believe all that you say and whether it’s true. It is the effort to stay awake.*

**Philosophy and spirituality are linked.

---
Page: 92

*This chapter is about one such pattern of reasoning that Socrates uses constantly. You offer a view. Socrates asks you to state the principle behind it—the premise that leads to your result. Then he asks questions that show your principle is too narrow; it leaves out things that it needs to cover. Or your principle is too broad; it includes things that it shouldn’t. You keep refining what you say to bring it nearer to the truth. You may never get there, but you’re closer at the end than you were at the start.*

**This reminds me of a pendulum.

---
Page: 92

*Systole and diastole. The Socratic method makes constant use of two operations of the mind. The first is seeing similarities between things that look different. The second is seeing differences between things that look similar. Socrates very often says either “you’re drawing too many distinctions” or “you aren’t drawing enough.”*

**Expand your idea, make it cover more ground, generalize to more cases. Then contract the definition, make it more narrow, cut things out from it. 

---
Page: 95

*These arguments are all different ways of saying similar things: You’re thinking too small; you’re inventing distinctions that don’t matter, or are distracted by false distinctions that others have drawn. Try looking at these many things as one thing. It’s all systole.*

**It's when you don't see the forest for the trees. 

---
Page: 100

*STRANGER. You and I have come to an understanding not only about the name of the angler’s art, but about the definition of the thing itself. One half of all art was acquisitive—half of the acquisitive art was conquest or taking by force, half of this was hunting, and half of hunting was hunting animals, half of this was hunting water animals—of this again, the under half was fishing, half of fishing was striking; a part of striking was fishing with a barb, and one half of this again, being the kind which strikes with a hook and draws the fish from below upwards, is the art which we have been seeking, and which from the nature of the operation is denoted angling or drawing up.
Sophist 221ac*

**I imagine this as a tree block diagram where each level is a small piece of the greater whole. One can start at the level of cosmos and borrow down to the level of quarks and fundamental forces. 

---
Page: 99

*And if we can’t come up with an airtight definition of a concept, we still can earn provisional knowledge that one thing is an example of another—enough to allow you to say, “I have a working definition that seems right; I’ll let it go if there’s a good argument against it, but it’s been through testing and I haven’t heard one yet.” The Socratic mindset is also hospitable to generalizations, including defective ones—as long as you know that’s what they are and have decided that they are the best you can do for now. What Socrates can’t stand is the generalization that its holder believes is right without understanding the ways in which it isn’t.*

**In a way what's important is that there's alignment of understanding. If two people call the same thing something different but agree that they're talking about the same thing then progress can be made without sharing language. Though without definitions it's going to be hard for others to follow up, without definitions the discussion is not as scalable.

---
Page: 89

*Applicability. The remarkable point about consistency is the power of it as a value or goal. When that value is hooked up to the mechanism of Socratic questioning, it doesn’t just annihilate. It can also be productive. It destroys a bad idea but can help confirm a sound one. It can tear down a way of life and then generate one that is better. And it is relevant to every little choice we make, not just to the big ones. The search for consistency thus makes the Socratic method useful in all sorts of situations, not just the kind we usually associate with moral philosophy.*

**Guiding principles and constraints can help you be better without telling you how. What principles, guidelines and constraints do I want for my life? One of them is definitely that everything is up for debate and can change. 

---
Page: 106

*This style of inquiry is a good example of how Socrates reasons about hard and unfamiliar things by starting with easy and familiar ones. Begin with what you know—with distinctions and examples that you’re sure about. Then try to map them onto the problems that you aren’t so sure about. See where the fit is easy and where it’s hard, and ask why. If someone is struggling to give the kind of answer that you’re hoping to talk about, show what that kind of answer would look like in a setting where it’s easy to understand.*

**Nudging at the border of the known is what exploring the unknown is all about.

---
Page: 105

*These analogies are, among other things, tools for clarification. Socrates uses them to help along his partner’s understanding without the need for an abstract explanation. Analogies work in part because we often can see and feel the force of a comparison before we can explain why (or even if we can’t explain why). They show rather than tell. Instead of saying “be more general,” Socrates talks in examples and says “do it like this.”*

**Being prompted the right way makes it easier for people to come up with an answer. You pre-filter the search space for them. 

---
Page: 108

*This example shows how an analogy, once established, can be turned to make a clinching point. These two things are alike in many ways, yes, but then they differ in this final way. The same claim could have been made without an analogy. Socrates could have said that you should be careful who you listen to because it’s hard to unlearn a bad idea once you’ve taken it in. But the analogy adds force by setting up a contrast. Think of how much more danger is found here than in food.*

**Understanding is helped by good stories.

---
Page: 111

*Why analogies? We’ve seen that analogies are a routine part of Socratic discourse. Plato was self-conscious about their constant use. He has his other characters talk about it. A critical example:
CALLICLES. You simply never stop going on and on about cobblers and fullers and cooks and doctors, as if they had the slightest relevance to our discussion.
Gorgias 491a*

**This way or criticizing yourself is very interesting. 

---
Page: 112

*Socrates thinks of ideas as every bit as important—more so, indeed— as what we can see and touch, and he tries to get others to look at them that way, too.4 He wants people to care for their insides (the psyche, the soul) with the kind of energy and attention they spend on their physical selves and whatever else they see. Think of Socrates as up against a bias: we treat what is available to our senses more seriously than what is only available to our minds. He is at war with that bias. Analogies are a weapon against it.*

**It's about grounding yourself and your partner, about making the vast and intangible tangible. 

---
Page: 114

*The epagoge and the analogy are staples of Socratic argument. They are similar because they both involve working back and forth between particulars that are familiar and concepts that aren’t. A lot of the action in Socratic moral reasoning happens in that bottom-up fashion: Is a given case more like this one or that one? What can we gather from the things we know? Socrates seeks agreement to simple claims, then leverages the agreement into big claims.*

**What do we know? What do we need to know? Where are we? Where do we need to go? 

---
Page: 116

*SOCRATES sets out rules for engaging in dialogue. This chapter looks at some of them: trying to find the truth, rather than trying to win; examining people, not just claims; judging arguments on their merits regardless of who makes them; candor, or saying what you think; the one-witness principle— that is, treating the other party to the dialogue as the judge of what it has shown; the principle of charity; and not giving or taking offense.*

**You should have rules that promotes the best discussions in terms of getting closer to your goals or discovering something new. What are the meta constraints for setting up rules for dialog?

---
Page: 116

*Rules taken lightly. Some of the rules that Socrates offers can be described as “rules” only with unease, because Socrates himself has an uneasy relationship to rules. He makes them and breaks them. He tells his partners not to make long speeches, then he makes a long speech.1 He uses some bad arguments, giving rise to debate later about whether he did it on purpose.2 He seems earnest; he seems disingenuous. He brings irony to philosophy and then dies for philosophy.*

**Art and creativity exists in polarities and paradoxes, seeming contradictions. It's the yin and the yang, the light and the dark.

---

*Modern philosophers usually argue about questions in the abstract and try to settle them for everyone. Socrates is different because he’s interested in the general questions and in how they play out in the people he examines.
His method implies that separating them isn’t easy and maybe isn’t desirable.*

**The understanding, the knowledge of truth resides within people. That's why our society can be built on stories like government and money.

*The personal aspect of Socratic inquiry can also explain the slow rate of progress in moral philosophy. Some of the questions that troubled humanity thousands of years ago trouble us now about as much. This should be unsurprising if we look at philosophy the way Socrates did. Philosophy of the Socratic kind has to be carried out from scratch in each person who tries it.*

**Are we able to bootstrap this in ourselves somehow? Does not the cultural artifacts that we build aim to do this?

*And the impersonal character of reason runs deeper than the avoidance of insult. So far as Socrates is concerned, the value of an argument is independent of the identity of the person making it. That is why he will talk to anyone and listen to anyone. He is ready to refute what is said by the mighty, and he will accept refutation from any source so long as the reasoning is sound.*

**It's a mindset that helps you avoid the defer to experts bias.

Page: 123

*Why do we need a rule about this? First, because insisting that the players say what they think keeps the focus where it’s supposed to be: on the truth.18 Speaking anything other than the truth of your own views also retards the care of the psyche. It is like lying to a doctor or therapist. It means you really can’t be treated because you won’t be affected by the experience. And if nobody is affected by a dialogue, it’s a waste of time.
The point is familiar from a teacher’s standpoint. If you want students to be changed by their time in the classroom, it’s best for them to put their true opinions on the line. If they say what they think the teacher wants to hear, there’s not much learning.*

**This rings true in creative pursuits too. Everybody needs to be candid and vulnerable to find the best solutions. It's doubly true for when you're examining yourself, there's nothing to be gained by inner dialogue if you're not going to participate wholeheartedly. 

---
Page: 124

*There are beliefs people talk about, and then others that they hold but do not want to speak. It is impossible to make serious progress in conversation until both kinds of beliefs are brought forth. So it is part of the Socratic questioner’s job to encourage honesty. It is best done in the way that Socrates shows. The honest claim will be challenged and probed, but the maker of the claim will not be condemned. Quite the contrary: one who says something shocking should be thanked for putting the claim on the table so that it can be rationally talked about and tested.
The act of doing so is a personal risk taken in part for the good of the community. Other people are probably having the same thought but not saying so. And the unspoken thing might be closer to the truth than the thing spoken.*

**The listener has a big responsibility in opening up the speaker.

---
Page: 124

*Candor has to be self-policed, and the policing can fail. You can cheat at Socratic inquiry without getting caught. And that can happen even when you test your own beliefs. Here a rule of candor might seem silly because of course you have no reason to be anything but frank when you talk to yourself. But there’s no “of course” about it. It’s common to falsely imagine you believe something that you don’t but wish you did, and then no one is around to point out what claptrap it is. The self-image may be protected as cautiously as a public image; the urgency and difficulty of candor can be greatest when confronting oneself.*

**When you have truths that you don't want to admit to yourself,  your creating a haunted house in the interior of your mind. 

---
Page: 126

*The one-witness idea serves several purposes. First, you can’t be expected to say what you think if you’re worried that the world won’t like it. The single-witness idea tries to keep such social pressure out of a dialogue by rule. Second, Socratic dialogue is supposed to rely on reasoning by the parties to it and nothing else. The one-witness rule keeps them from treating anyone else as a source of authority.22 And it’s a reminder that sound reasoning and popular reasoning are utterly different things.*

**I've seen others and myself change what they're saying depending on the people in the room. It's hard to stand up to crowds. It shouldn't be, one should find joy in when they see something that others don't. And if you've reached your conclusions through honest inquiry, you should feel confident in it because it's the sharpest truth available to you at the time.

---
Page: 127

*If you feel like calling witnesses to claim that what I’m saying is wrong, you can count on your position being supported by almost everyone in Athens.… Nevertheless, there’s still a dissenting voice, albeit a single one—mine. You’re producing no compelling reason why I should agree with you; all you’re doing is calling up a horde of false witnesses against me to support your attempt to dislodge me from my inheritance, the truth.*

**It feels like you need help to be this strong. Having a moral conviction might be the way to go. Find your values and stick to them. It's easier to stand up for something that's not you. Is that the cowards way out?

---
Page: 129

*That is a good test of Socratic progress:
the extent of one’s inclination and ability to come up with strong objections to one’s own views, and indeed to do it better than one’s opponents can.
In modern times the practices just described are sometimes summed up as a principle of charity: interpreting what others say in the most reasonable ways you can, and putting the arguments of others in their best light. That principle has been attributed to many authors; like most important intellectual procedures, though, it goes back to Socrates. When he challenges a position, he generally challenges it in its strongest and most appealing form, and sometimes that means doing the other side’s job for them. Socrates, in short, runs toward the hard problems for his position. To state the point as practical advice for dialogue: consider the best case for your adversary or partner, not the best case for you.*

**The most interesting thinkers of our time are very good at steelmanning the other side. It's only when your own views can stand up to the fiercest of critique that they are worthy of holding. They are also good at having debates in good faith.

---
Page: 131

*Offense isn’t only a problem when it’s given and taken in fact. The risk of offense is a problem in advance because it makes people dishonest. When they are worried about the other side taking offense, they don’t say what they really think, and progress toward the truth is over. Everyone pretends to agree more than they do. That’s a common problem now, as it was then. Pushing past that fear is part of the Socratic method. It takes courage, and a commitment on both sides not to treat the dispute as personal no matter where the ideas may go.*

**It's a special state of mind when the truth is the only thing that is important. When people can be vulnerable they can stretch their wings.

---
Page: 132

*The Socratic function in the mind, as in the dialogues, works like a gyroscope. It helps maintain orientation; it compensates. When his partners don’t have confidence, Socrates encourages them. When they’re inflated, he deflates them. The Socratic instinct in the self can operate the same way. In its caustic moments the Socratic function does some of the work of the fool or court jester in Shakespeare. Its job is to be offensive when the ego overrates itself. It pokes at self-importance and hubris when they need mockery; it looks long and hard for the emperor’s clothes and doesn’t find them. And it shows surprise and chagrin when the emperor is enraged.*

**You need balance, otherwise you'll tip over to one unproductive state of mind or the other. I doubt that this only applies to confidence. 

---
Page: 134

*Instead of moving through a series of certainties, you get used to searching without certainty. There is a lump under the mattress and you toss and turn in trying to deal with it and finally accept that you will never fully come to rest and that’s all right. The lump is ignorance. Ignorance is many things in Socratic philosophy: a shocking discovery, a chronic condition, a motivator, an enemy, perhaps an inevitability.*

**In this universe with our limited capacity, it's the only intellectually honest position one can hold. Feeling bad is not necessarily an indicator that you're not doing the right thing. 

---
Page: 135

*If we treat Socrates as an internalized feature of the mind, then this is its first and constant order of business: uprooting false conceits of knowledge.
Otherwise those conceits, like weeds, block the growth of anything better.
Socrates regards the actual presence of wisdom and the feeling of having it as inversely related.*

**The dunnen-kruger effect.

---
Page: 139

*Knowledge in the sense of final, inquiry-ending certainty is what he doesn’t have and can’t find. But he has a lot of “for now” knowledge that has been tested for consistency many times over and has yet to fail, and this allows him a measure of virtue. “Knowing,” on this view, is a matter of degree. Socrates is making all the progress he can: not much, perhaps, but more than most.*

**It's a philosophically honest view of knowledge that's still pragmatic. We can't be paralyzed by our own ignorance.

---
Page: 140

*First, Socrates regards unconscious ignorance as the source of great evils.
Ignorance is why we go wrong in general. People have vices, do wrong, and make themselves wretched because they don’t really understand what they are doing and why. They haven’t thought hard enough about it. But there’s a special tier of Socratic dread and contempt for double ignorance—the ignorance of those who don’t know but think they do. Everyone is in that position sometimes. We have a felt sense of confidence built on sand. It wouldn’t survive cross-examination but doesn’t receive any. Those in that position are badly off and also dangerous to others, like drunk drivers who think they are sober.*

**It's NPCs and douchebags, one is tragic and the other harmful.

---
Page: 142

*Socratic philosophy starts with a love of truth, but as a matter of action its first task is negative: shaking off the delusion of wisdom. Before worrying about adding to your knowledge, you have to get clear—clearer than anyone naturally wants to be—about what you don’t know and where your false certainties lie. They’re hard to see and they resist attack. The best strategy against them is an internalized Socrates who says that you’re not as wise as you seem to yourself. That is as close as we can get to the feeling and the posture of the wise.*

**After the recognition of one's own ignorance, what's the next step?

---
Page: 143

*But I have this feature in common with midwives—I myself am barren of wisdom. The criticism that’s often made of me—that it’s lack of wisdom that makes me ask others questions, but say nothing positive myself—is perfectly true. Why do I behave like this? Because the god compels me to attend to the labors of others, but prohibits me from having any offspring myself. I myself, therefore, am quite devoid of wisdom; my mind has never produced any idea that could be called clever.…*

**Is this a critique of Socrates as not enough to reach truth? That shedding light on the ignorance is just the first step and that we ourselves need to take it further. 

---
Page: 144

*The midwife comparison suggests a way to listen to someone else. But its more likely use, as with most of what Socrates offers, is internal. Think of it as a posture of mind when you’re looking at an idea or a hard question. You want to see the idea in full and at its best before you criticize it. Socrates spends the time needed to help Theaetetus work out what he means and how to say it—then he takes it apart. This is much better than the usual habit of shading an opponent’s argument to make it look bad before you argue against it. It’s also a form of self-discipline when you weigh an idea that goes against your own beliefs. You don’t just try to remember that you might be wrong. You try to forget for a while whatever you already think.*

**Steelman every idea even though it you disagree with it fundamentally. Take multiple perspectives and steelman each. Find the synthesis between all the perspectives and reach a higher order, deeper truth. Than break the truth apart and build it back up stronger. Do this more times than anyone else and you'll be at the edge of knowledge. And the edge is still just at the beginning of what's possible.

Page: 147

*Aporia is a kind of impasse; literally it means “without a way.” It is the state reached when your attempts to say something true have all been refuted and you don’t know what else to do or think. Sometimes it is described as a state of mind—a sense of disorientation and perplexity; but strictly speaking those states are a reaction to the impasse. They are what you feel when you run out of resources for answering a question. Your feet are trying to find something solid to stand on and can’t.*

**I would like to push myself to the edge and experience this.

---
Page: 148

*Aporia is a common way for Socratic dialogues to end. Producing aporia is sometimes thought to be their purpose. That may be another reason why Plato writes in the way he does. Aporia is more likely to be produced by participating in a dialogue, or by reading one, than by direct exposition. A dialogue that seems to go nowhere can be very productive if its goal was to produce aporia instead of a conclusion.*

**Can there be progress without conclusions? 

---
Page: 151

*The aporetic spur. Aporia can not only prepare you to learn but make you want to learn.4 It feels frustrating. In effect Socrates says: good—now get going on the search for an answer, this time with a better sense of the work it takes. You are made hungry for knowledge by discovering how little you have.*

**The more broad my knowledge becomes the wider my ignorance of my ignorance becomes. There are so many topics that I'm most likely underestimating completely. I can't in good faith keep talking about them as if I knew anything, I fact that would be the primary thing to prevent me from learning more. What is AI truly? Not just surface level bullshit, what is it?

**That feeling of frustration is probably crucial for forcing the brain to react and go into a state of learning.

---
Page: 150

*For all these reasons, Theaetetus, we must admit that refutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications, and he who has not been refuted, though he be the Great King himself, is in an awful state of impurity; he is uninstructed and deformed in those things in which he who would be truly blessed ought to be fairest and purest.*

**It's hard to be refuted and it's hard to find people that will refuted. If one becomes good at being refuted perhaps people around you will become better at doing it?

---
Page: 152

*Aporia as continuous. We’ve just talked as though there are right answers to the questions under pursuit, and that aporia might inspire a harder search for them. But suppose you conclude, after many rounds of all this, that the answers will never be found. It still wouldn’t be time to give up. On a Socratic view it’s never time to give up. We do better by accepting that the search probably has no end but going on anyway as if it might. For even if you can’t possess the truth, you can get closer to it. Discourse that improves understanding becomes the valuable thing, but it works best if you forget that and act as though you’re in it to capture the truth.*

**Knowledge is indeed an infinite game and we can only ever be at the beginning of an infinity. Embrace this fact and it'll change what is the best mindset to approach knowledge creation with.

---
Page: 152

*Aporetic truths. A more radical view of aporia regards it as sometimes inspiring speechlessness because you have arrived at a truth that can’t be spoken. The idea goes: there are unspeakable truths—that is, truths that defy language, and so can be called ineffable.5 Perhaps they are verbal analogues of irrational numbers. But they sometimes can be perceived without words. It may be that justice, for example, can’t be captured by a definition. But it can be encircled by the close failure of many efforts at definition. Instead of that result seeming to be a mess and therefore a failure, the mess is the thing sought. The goal of the effort at reasoning isn’t a conclusion based on the reasoning but a grasp of something larger. We learn that the truth isn’t coextensive with our ability to talk about it or with our powers of comprehension.*

**This is congruent with psychedelic exploration. It's congruent with spirituality. The way that can't be spoken of. It's congruent with Koans, that embrace the ineffable and come up with phrases to make you, not understand it through words but rather experience it.

---
Page: 154

*Since the Socratic approach to aporia never involves giving up in response to it, the risks of an unearned sense of aporia might not be too serious. If aporia makes people work harder to find the truth, perhaps it doesn’t matter whether it was brought on by a bad argument. And if aporia creates a more humble and accurate impression of your own wisdom, again it might be good no matter how it arrives. But unearned aporia still seems as objectionable as any other false state from a Socratic standpoint (you wouldn’t want it for yourself, would you?). Maybe a claim of aporia should be subject to the same testing as every other claim.*

**I honestly feel this way about things like skills and competence. When I'm in state where I feel weak and defeated, it ignites a fire in me to become better in order to not feel that way again.

*Imagine that one of them has been set free and is suddenly made to stand up, to turn his head and walk, and to look towards the firelight. It hurts him to do all this and he’s too dazzled to be capable of making out the objects whose shadows he’d formerly been looking at. And suppose someone tells him that what he’s been seeing all this time has no substance, and that he’s now closer to reality and is seeing more accurately, because of the greater reality of the things in front of his eyes—what do you imagine his reaction would be? And what do you think he’d say if he were shown any of the passing objects and had to respond to being asked what it was? Don’t you think he’d be bewildered and would think that there was more reality in what he’d been seeing before than in what he was being shown now?*

**We cling to worldviews and the ineffable is too scary to accept.

---
Page: 159

*And suppose that before his eyes had settled down and while he wasn’t seeing well, he had once again to compete against those same old prisoners at identifying those shadows. Wouldn’t he make a fool of himself? Wouldn’t they say that he’d come back from his upward journey with his eyes ruined, and that it wasn’t even worth trying to go up there? And wouldn’t they—if they could—grab hold of anyone who tried to set them free and take them up there, and kill him?*

**Seeing things differently is frowned upon, it's alienating.

*Departure from the cave doesn’t meet any felt need of the inmates. It doesn’t make them any cheerier, and doesn’t make them better off in any worldly way. But few who assess the story from the outside would rather be in the cave than out of it. We might call getting out of the cave a Socratic good: something assigned not much value (or maybe negative value) by those who haven’t done it, but regarded as very valuable once they have.*

**George Hotz made an argument about us being tigers at the Zoo. We're well fed and safe but there's something awfully wrong with our reality. Being out in the wild is more dangerous but being in a cage means you are not free. The prison of our ignorance may be safe but it's not desirable.

*People to whom intelligence and goodness are unfamiliar, whose only interest is self-indulgence and so on, spend their lives moving aimlessly to and fro between the bottom and the halfway point, which is as far as they reach. But they never travel any further towards the true heights: they’ve never even looked up there, let alone gone there; they aren’t really satisfied by anything real; they don’t experience steady, pure pleasure. They’re no different from cattle.*

**This is the feeling I get when observing people at all exclusive resorts.

*These passages invite the reader to stand over here, to reflect on people over there who are like farm animals, and to contemplate their wretchedness. And then they invite consideration of the extent to which we are fooling ourselves by assuming that distanced perspective, because we too are part of the herd. Call these cases of looking back, or down: using what you can see to help think about what you can’t. It’s hard to see the value of insight that you don’t have—to see it, that is, by looking forward, or up. It’s easier to appreciate the value of whatever insight you do have that others don’t. Then you can think about the horror of not having it. Then you think about the possibility that, from a different point of view, you don’t have it. Then you realize it’s more than a possibility; it’s certain. Then you get to work.*

**Just seconds ago I was bathing in certainty that everyone is below me. It's like I got immediately slapped back to reality. In what cases am I the ignorant? Probably in more to count.

---
Page: 164

*When you get out of a cave, you don’t want to go back. The revulsion at the thought of going backward can drive a desire to go forward. For after enough experience with caves, you realize that we’re all trapped in some and we’ve all escaped from others. Backward and forward movement are both possible; why should movement one way be more important than the other?
The value of understanding is the same whether we’re gaining it or losing it. So our attachment to whatever wisdom we have should generate an equivalent appetite for more. Put differently, your understanding is currently in a state that you would, with some progress, regard with horror.
Best, then, to make haste now.*

**What caves do I have in my mind? Which caves should I be looking for first? If you're in the cave, how do you look for it?  Take a topic and start looking around. I would like to prioritize the things I think I value.

*It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied;
better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, is of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.*

**I agree but I don't know why. Why is it better to not be a fool? Is it a dogma or axiom that it should be so?

Page: 166

*Socratic injuries. The notion of Socratic goods can be turned around and seen as a parallel problem of injuries. Suppose you go through your life enjoyably enough, only to discover toward the end that you’ve been laboring under a mistake. You think you’re surrounded by friends and family who love you, but then you find out that they’ve always hated you, so you become miserable. A sad story. Now suppose instead that you’re in a situation of this kind but never learn the truth. What kind of harm you have suffered? Or take a side view of the problem once more: you see someone else in a situation like that—a dupe—cheerfully engaged in a way of life that would disgust him if he knew the truth of it, but he doesn’t. Should you envy such a person? Again, Plato thought not.*

**Ignorance is bliss but it's appalling. 

---
Page: 167

*Socratic injuries are pervasive; we bear them as part of the human condition. Think of someone who acts unethically or without reflection but gets away with it and is pleased. Such a person can be viewed like a patient with dementia—not necessarily a deteriorating patient, but one who is steadily feeble-minded, oblivious to the problem, and indifferent or hostile when informed of it. Such people will often be in good spirits, yet to know them is to dread their condition. It is useful to reflect on that sense of dread, and to realize that Socrates would feel some of the same if he were to watch you. His function is to wake us from the degrees of dementia in which we’re all submerged. The more we need the help, the less we want it.*

**If we're able to view ourselves from a 3rd person perspective, we might be able to more easily end up in a state where we try to change. That's why psychedelics are so useful. They help us see though the fiction that our ego has built for us. Having that said, that fiction is often very useful for operating in society.

*They have become tense and neurotic. They know how to speak flatteringly to their master and how to behave to get into his good books, but their minds are narrow and crooked. They became slaves when they were young, and slavery prohibits growth, integrity and freedom, makes devious deeds inevitable, and puts minds that are still impressionable through extremes of danger and fear, which cannot be dealt with honestly and truthfully. So in no time at all they turn to deceit and repaying wrong with further wrong; they become warped and stunted in many ways. In the end, when they become adults, they are left with minds which are incapable of a single wholesome thought. They have become highly skilled and intelligent—or so they think.*

**This is what I'm afraid of if I'm not in control of my own company. 

---
Page: 169

*Socratic injuries may be suffered culturally as well as individually. A society can be wretched in ways that are invisible to itself, but perhaps clear to outsiders or clear to the society’s own members when they later view themselves in retrospect. The injuries can be matters of regress as well as failures of progress; a culture can be slow in learning, or can forget truths that it once knew and why it ever cared about them. These general patterns are familiar to all. I mention them here because they can sometimes be viewed in the Socratic way we have been considering. Wretchedness can occur because points of tension in the values of the society have not yet been brought to its collective awareness in a clear enough way. Either few can see those points or few are willing to hear about them. The truth may seem too uncomfortable to bear study or not uncomfortable enough to require adjustment. Economics, and technologies that change economics, do much to shape people’s willingness to take such tensions seriously. When the cost of confronting a truth goes down (or the cost of ignoring it goes up), people get more willing to ask and answer questions about it. And vice versa.*

**Much like in the mind, there's a threshold that needs to be crossed and once it is, change is catalyzed.

*Socratic philosophy treats eudaimonia as its final goal. That word will be translated here as happiness, which is most common.1 Some say eudaimonia is better translated as well-being, or as living well. The issue arises because in English it’s natural to think of happiness as a subjective state: it means feeling good. But eudaimonia has an objective aspect. It implies a judgment from the outside that someone is doing well. It means a good life, not just a good mood; a good life is one to which felt happiness is the right response. People can enjoy themselves in despicable ways and so not be described as happy in this Greek sense even if they seem to be having a good time. The opposite of happy, on this view, wouldn’t be gloomy or depressed; it would be a word like wretched or pitiable.*

**I like Joscha Bach's view on this, he doesn't want a specific emotion or state he wants to have the right state depending on the context he is in. 

---
Page: 172

*That is how Socrates thinks about most things that people describe as good—money, power, even health. They’re good if you use them in wise ways and bad if you use them in bad ways. So wisdom, or virtue—these are the things that really matter (and Socrates is not inclined to distinguish between those words, as we shall see). They are the only things that are good no matter what; they are the only certain sources of the good life or, in a word, happiness.*

**Wisdom and virtue, huh? Will it make you immortal? Is immortality good or bad or should one care about it at all? It is the fear of death that drives it. The fear of death drives many bad things, such as attachment and suffering. Would immortality cure those things? Is the desire for immortality what's bad and not immortality itself?

---
Page: 172

*This is sometimes called the “identity thesis” because it states that virtue and happiness are the same.*

**Happiness in the sense of living well seems like a virtue to me, but there can be many more virtues than that right?

---
Page: 174

*Neither Meletus nor Anytus [the prosecutors] can do me any harm at all; they would not have the power, because I do not believe that the law of God permits a better man to be harmed by a worse. No doubt my accuser might put me to death or have me banished or deprived of civic rights, but even if he thinks—as he probably does, and others too, I dare say—that these are great calamities, I do not think so. I believe that it is far worse to do what he is doing now, trying to put an innocent man to death.*

**If you are that confident in yourself you truly become an immovable force. Though it's only as strong as what it's rooted in. Is the concept of God the strongest force one can root virtue in?

---
Page: 174

*It can be startling to hear Socrates treat knowledge and virtue as the same. Knowledge sounds like something you have in your mind. Virtue sounds like a property of actions you might take. So it seems easy to have one without the other. It’s a familiar experience for anyone, for example, to think that an act would be virtuous but not do it. The old word for that is akrasia: acting against your better judgment, or having a failure of will. Our experience of such moments makes knowledge and virtue seem to be very different things.*

**One can have knowledge of virtue but act against it. Are they truly the same? If you act against it then it's not knowledge in the socratic sense. The deeper kind of knowledge which includes controlling your behavior towards what you know to be virtuous. 

---
Page: 175

*It is the long-standing policy of this book not to argue in the abstract when we can instead approach a question Socratically—that is, by asking how a claim might be supported in your own knowledge and experience.
Look at it this way, then: There are probably temptations that you now resist easily just because you understand them. There are drugs you don’t take and things you don’t eat. You know they would feel good or taste good, and yet you don’t even experience them as temptations. Why not?
Because you know too much. You know where they lead and how you will feel if you go there. If someone were to congratulate you on your willpower in declining to take those drugs, you would likely shrug and say that willpower doesn’t really enter into it. You just know better.
Socrates thinks everything is like that, or could be. When you have a failure of will, it’s really a failure to reach the state just described: a failure to know better. If you say, “I did know better, but I couldn’t stop myself,” he would reply that some of your knowledge got away from you. Of course this implies a certain view of what it means to “know” something. When you avoid dangerous drugs or other things, it isn’t only because you can recite their dangers. It is because you know about those dangers in a deeper sense. You are completely conscious of them; they register in full.
Sometimes we don’t have that kind of knowledge; we only have the kind that is associated with recital. We have faux knowledge, and we are weak.*

**Really interesting to see a difficult abstract concept be described so accurately with an everyday experience. And regarding the experience in question, it is a little bit like the difference between knowing something intellectually and knowing something emotionally. The later is a deeper understanding that usually only comes from experience. It's more visceral and it had greater influence on behavior.

---
Page: 176

*Socrates has more to say about failures of knowledge that look like failures of will. The “knowledge” you are missing in a moment of weakness often turns out to be an understanding of costs and benefits—that is, a complete and enlightened understanding of them. Socrates speaks in the Protagoras, for example, of temptations as giving us pleasure now and making us unhappy later. When that’s a bad trade, it’s a kind of measurement error caused by the hard time we have giving due weight now to how we will feel in the future.8 You would act differently if all those future consequences were right in front of you. But you don’t see the future that accurately or vividly. And this is, indeed, a problem of knowledge.*

**To live in the future, to have a low time preference, to play infinite games. Having the imaginative power to truly know what an action implies.

*Turn that vision around, make it less extreme, and you have the general Socratic interpretation of moral failure. When you fail to do the right thing —even for the sake of others—it’s not really a question of will. It happens because you aren’t seeing the situation “all in all,” or you aren’t seeing the effect on other people up close, or you aren’t understanding that they are just as important as you are. It’s a failure of knowledge.*

**This kind of says that all evil people are the opposite of wise and knowledgeable. And it also points to an objectivity in morality. The more knowledge we have the more good we would do to ourselves and the world around us, that must mean that the knowledge found contained some truth that objectively makes it right to treat others well.

*Socrates thus turns all apparent problems of ethics—of how to live and act —into problems of knowledge and intelligence. Or perhaps he turns them into one problem of knowledge, since he seems to argue at points for the “unity of virtues”: the idea that if you have any of the virtues in full, you will have them all. They amount to the same deep understanding of the good and the bad, just dressed in different forms.*

**This addresses my point about multiple virtues. If they're all the same at the end then virtue can equal knowledge.

---
Page: 179

*Turning to the practical, it is a good Socratic exercise to try interpreting every wrongful or unvirtuous act done by anyone in the way we’ve seen: as a failure of knowledge or understanding. Some cases are challenging to view this way, as when people are up against physical addictions or are otherwise acting without any kind of thought at all. But it’s usually possible to at least look at any bad decision from the Socratic angle. Sometimes it helps to ask why an omniscient person wouldn’t have done it—that is, someone who had perfect knowledge of the future, of others and their experiences, and so forth. If the decision was emotional, you can ask whether the emotions would have been the same if the understandings and knowledge that provoked them were different.*

**To understand beyond just the surface of the behavior is to become more compassionate.

*If virtue is a kind of knowledge, then what is it knowledge of ? If the answer is measurement of “what’s good for you,” or what tends toward eudaimonia, then we might seem to have gotten nowhere, because what’s good for you is—virtue. We need a better idea of what this knowledge is about, besides being knowledge that knowledge is everything.*

**I interpret as knowing the truth of the universe. It's about seeing the patterns that are congruent with maximally discovering novelty and fighting entropy. It's in some sense not even that, it's the ineffable truth beyond what can be explained in words. The closer you are to that the closer you are to God.

*Living as we do among such people, who are so confused, and don’t know what they’re saying, or what evil they have within them, or where they got it from, or how they can get rid of it, we should constantly be focusing our attention, I think, on the following thoughts: “Could it be, perhaps, that I too am one of these people? What kind of person do I picture myself as being?
How do I conduct myself? Is it really as a wise person, as someone who has control of himself? Can I say for my part that I’ve been educated to face everything that may come? Is it indeed the case, as is fitting for someone who knows nothing, that I’m aware that I know nothing?”*

**I really should be more humble to cattle.

*Stoicism often amounts to the practice of pushing through the surfaces of impressions that seem natural. Socratic questioning is a way to carry out that process.*

**By definition there's the least amount of truth at the surface level.

*His topics are usually more specific, his inquiries less complicated, and his results more practical than those of the Socrates shown to us by Plato.*

**Being more specific makes the Socratic method more concrete, practical and efficient.

*Peace of mind depends on securing an unchanging and definite judgment. Other people constantly lose and regain their footing, as they oscillate between letting things go and pursuing them.
What is the reason for this instability? It is that nothing is certain for people who reply on popular opinion, the most unreliable of standards.*

**Deepen your knowledge about the invariants of the world.

*As that passage suggests, health, wealth, and other such externals that aren’t good or bad in themselves were called “indifferents” by the Stoics. The ones that are helpful if used wisely became known as preferred indifferents.*

**The challenge is in knowing how to wield anything wisely. It includes even your preferences and interests. Somehow they're as given to you as your genetics. 

---
Page: 196

*Fear is an opinion of an impending evil that seems unbearable.*

**This ties courage and knowledge together well for me. The things you fear stay scary when you don't look at them and examine them thoroughly for what they are. The fear prevents you from even starting to look, if you get over that hurdle you'll be able to vanquish fear. Often times something is scary because it's totally unknown, so you conjure up the worst possible scenarios.

---
Page: 195

*Stoicism makes the practical meaning of the Socratic teachings more clear.
The Stoics talk about how to handle various problems of life—vanity, anger, fear, greed. They don’t just say, as Socrates did, that those can be considered problems of knowledge. They show how those problems might be addressed accordingly. They start by suggesting that your apparent problems in the world can often be reinterpreted as problems in your thinking.*

**Socrates is like the interface and stoicism the implementation.

Page: 197

*Whenever someone does you a wrong or speaks ill of you, remember that he is doing what he thinks is proper. He can’t possibly be guided by what appears right to you, but only by what appears right to him. So if he sees things wrongly, he is the one who is hurt, because he is the one who has been deceived.… Starting from this reasoning, you will be mild toward whoever insults you. Say each time, “So it seemed to him.”*

**I've applied this a little bit over the years, it really does make you more compassionate. What's been tricky for me is how to balance it with holding people accountable.  

---
Page: 198

*Bravery is not thoughtless rashness, or love of danger, or the courting of fear-inspiring objects; it is the knowledge which enables us to distinguish between that which is evil and that which is not.*

**It is true that there are horrible things in the world and dangerous things that should be feared. Though in the grand scheme of things the evils that we as humans are currently able to commit are small at a cosmological scale.

---
Page: 199

*Some beliefs are held in the forefront of the mind and can be dropped or revised when you hear new evidence or arguments. Some run deeper and are hard to change even when we think we know better. You “know” that there is nothing to fear in some situation but you feel fear anyway; so in fact you don’t know it, or rather you have conflicting beliefs about whether there is anything to fear. Some of the beliefs will take time to root out because they are ingrained. You “know” that you don’t want something but you still feel desire for it—the same pattern: some of your beliefs haven’t caught up with others. A principal goal of philosophy is to bring all those beliefs into a state of consistency.19 It’s work.*

**Some of that work requires direct experience. I think that there are some emotional understandings that you can't reason your way to, you have to experience it.

---
Page: 199

*They describe this invulnerability as a matter of detaching yourself from externals—that is, from all things that are up to others. Instead you identify with what is up to you: your choices, your will, your understanding. No outside force can injure those things.*

**This reminds of 1984, where they eventually break down his spirit. I believe the fact that they got him at his core, is the reason why it hurts so much to hear it. It is true evil being perpetrated, it's harming the parts that should be invulnerable.

*A Skeptic thus is one who inquires (and inquires) without reaching a conclusion. Skeptics in the ancient tradition don’t say “no” to every claim, or indeed to any of them.
They just keep asking questions. They want the truth, and are always trying to get closer to it, but they never reach a stopping point; they never find certainty. They have a dread of “rash assent,” and of thinking that you’re done thinking before you really are. Skeptics regard that tendency as the great failing of humanity (probably—they aren’t certain, of course).3*

**In a certain sense being humble is the most honest way to live. Nobody knows the final truth, and living like you don't put you on a path where it makes sense to always go deeper.

---
Page: 205

*One of Plato’s students, Aristotle, left the Academy to found his own school (the Lyceum). Others stayed in the Academy and took Plato’s theories in various other directions in the century after his death. But the Skeptics thought these were all cases of going astray from the Socratic vision, which was to stick to questioning and come to rest on no final conclusions.*

**I'm more in agreement that we will never find the final answer. Every branch of knowledge is infinitely deep and one can only ever be at the beginning of an infinity.

---
Page: 205

*Both these schools, being impregnated with the copiousness of Plato, arranged a certain definite system of doctrine, which was itself copious and luxuriant; but abandoned the Socratic plan of doubting on every subject, and of discussing everything without ever venturing on the assertion of a positive opinion. And thus there arose what Socrates would have been far from approving.*

**I understand the felt need to get more certainty and perhaps more practical tools. It's a natural counter reaction to something as far to the abstract as the socratic method.

---
Page: 207

*First, epochē isn’t precisely what Socrates sought or produced. If you suspend judgment in the Skeptical way, you don’t say that a claim is right or wrong. You say that you don’t know. Socrates did something different.
His arguments produced aporia—an impasse—by refuting the efforts of others to show that they had mastered important concepts. In epochē, you don’t know what to do because you’re suspended between different arguments that could both be right. When encountering aporia, you don’t know what to do because all possible answers to a question—or all you can think of—have been shown to be wrong.*

**Aporia seems grander from a spiritual perspective. 

---
Page: 207

*As Paul Woodruff puts it: “Aporia leads to a state of epistemic frustration. Epochē, on the other hand, is a state of detachment from belief.”*

**Aporia is more optimistic and epoche is more cynical. It's always more productive to be optimistic. 

---
Page: 209

*One of them was called Pyrrhonian Skepticism (after its founder, Pyrrho of Elis).
Those Skeptics said the result of suspending judgment was ataraxia:
tranquility and freedom from distress, which was their goal.*

**A kind of acceptance, a kind of path of least resistance. 

---
Page: 210

*Academic Skeptics such as Arcesilaus were different. They weren’t trying to find tranquility. Their aim was to find the truth. They ended up in a state of suspended judgment because that’s where they thought reason left them.
Every claim can be undercut by some other; most of what anyone has ever believed has turned out to be wrong; so people who claim to be certain of anything are lazy or kidding themselves.
And yet the Academic Skeptics didn’t give up on their search for the truth. Falling short made them more diligent.*

**Every claim in history has turned out to be wrong, but on the way the temporary truth has been useful while it was taking on the mantle of truth, and it has also acted as a jumping off point for the next generation to reach truer truths.

---
Page: 212

*Whatever happens which is probable in appearance, if nothing offers itself which is contrary to that probability, the wise man will use it; and in this way the whole course of life will be regulated. And, in truth, that wise man whom you are bringing on the stage, is often guided by what is probable, not being comprehended, nor perceived, nor assented to, but only likely;
and unless a man acts on such circumstances there is an end to the whole system of life.*

**It would be unwise not to try and find truer truths, how else will you guide your exploration of what can be known? They are a coordinate in truth space that allows to better understand how inadequate it is.

---
Page: 212

*Carneades thus is associated with the idea of probability as a basis for action (though what he meant by “probable,” or its Greek equivalent, is a complex question; he didn’t have the mathematical idea of it that we do).17 We can’t reach certainty about moral and other questions, but we can arrive at conclusions that are likely enough to be true to make rational action possible on the basis of them. This position resembles what nowadays would be called fallibilism.
This idea from Carneades is valuable to users of the Socratic method; for whether or not Socrates was a Skeptic, his method can, as we’ve seen, easily make Skeptics out of its students. The mature Skeptic is comfortable going forward on the basis of probabilities, sometimes great and sometimes not. (How different, really, are the sciences now?) This approach allows vigorous action without an offensive attitude. Skeptics aren’t stubborn and don’t mind losing an argument.*

**I like this notion of probability, it let's you be humble but still decisive. 

---
Page: 218

*Good preliminary questions tee up the claims that the parties go on to pursue. That’s part of the secret of Socratic dialogue: getting a claim on the table that lends itself to productive questioning. Such claims don’t usually spring up right away or on their own. Sometimes they are developed by listening for a while; often they are developed by friendly questioning. The questions aren’t testing anything. They just draw out the views of your partner and steer them into a position that will support a good dialogue.*

**You need a good grasp on what the other person is trying to say in order to make follow-up arguments that makes sense to him, you'll say it as if he could have made that leap himself. It'll require attentive listening to get to the core of what the other person is saying. 

---
Page: 219

*Find the principle. Imagine arguing with someone about whether a movie is good. This goes on for a while, with both of you quarreling over details.
Then it occurs to you to ask: What is a good movie, anyway? What makes one better than another? You realize that you’ve been arguing about a particular movie—the question in the foreground—because you have different opinions about those larger questions in the background. The background questions are what you should be arguing about. Now replace the word “movie” with the word “act” or the word “life” and you have the usual Socratic inquiry.*

**If you want to resolve anything you need to be on some sort of common ground, only there can you meet eye to eye and see if there's a difference of opinion or if you'll have to agree to disagree. 

---
Page: 220

*The major premise is a general principle. The minor premise is a statement about a particular case. Why is this useful to understand? Because the general principle at stake in an argument often goes unstated and unexamined—the “inarticulate major premise,” as it’s sometimes called. The first thing Socrates does is smoke it out.*

**It's good to have made this conscious. It's something that I might have stumbled on by accident but this makes it possible to wield it.

---
Page: 221

*And so it goes. At any point you can choose: take the principle that’s been offered and use it to challenge an earlier claim; or make the new claim itself the subject of challenge and testing; or push to find another principle —probably one that’s more general.*

**These are tools to twist and turn and observe the question, looking at it from different angles until you spot imperfections. How deep can you go before you've lost touch with the original claim?

---
Page: 222

*Third, in some contexts you might climb another rung for a different reason: to find a proposition on which you can agree—in earnest, and not just for the sake of discussion. Most people do care about the same things when you reach a high enough level of generality. Establishing that point of departure early can have great value in efforts to persuade later. It allows you and your partner to reason together from a common understanding.
By whatever of these criteria it may be guided, Socratic discussion starts with a hunt for the right level of generality at which to talk.*

**Sometimes no matter how high you go you'll never find common ground, you're just completely different at your cores. That's informative too, and if you want to dig into the conversation you can let go of your own preconceptions and see it from their perspective. 

---
Page: 222

*Asking what a concept means can sound like a fuss about nothing. You seem to be bickering about the meaning of a word, and people don’t care about words; they care about real things. The point to stress in reply is that you aren’t just talking about a word. You’re talking about a judgment. The word under discussion is a placeholder for that judgment. If the word seems unimportant, no problem: we can use another one. Indeed, it’s sometimes useful to change out the word at issue for a different word or phrase from time to time, just to make clear that the discussion isn’t about semantics. It’s about a judgment.*

**When is it interesting to start examining? Whenever you have judgements about anything I suppose. I want to try it on myself first chance I get.

---
Page: 223

*How do you find the proposition in the background of a claim? A good route is often provided by a persistent use of the question why. The question is asked, and then asked again in a nearly childlike spirit—or if not in that simple form, then in the more complex shapes it can take: What is the purpose of the thing we are talking about? What is the reason for it? How do you know? What makes you so sure? And what is the reason for the reason? These kinds of questions can push through layers of principle that usually get more general at each step. They work because the major premise of an argument usually amounts, in conversation, to a reason why the conclusion is true. So asking about the reason for a conclusion takes you back to the premises behind it.*

**This is really useful in general for understanding anything more deeply.

---
Page: 224

*Another example of the same idea: should universities let students decide for themselves what classes to take, or should there be a required curriculum? Put that question in front of students, or parents, or professors, and you will get an earful of conflicting opinions that probably go past each other. Eventually you can push the discussion down a more Socratic and constructive path by asking the same kind of question as in the criminal case: what is the purpose of a university education? The answers to that question will amount to the major premises behind the views on offer.
Suppose the purpose is said to be X. Now you have the same three choices as usual. You can say: if the purpose is X, why is it advanced by your view about letting students decide what courses to take? Or you can say: are you sure the purpose is X? What about these other possible purposes? Or you can say: what does X mean? Or why is X important? Then the answers can be tested with other questions of the kind we’ll discuss in a moment.*


---
Page: 225

*But framing these as problems of why, or of purpose, is often a more intuitive way to cut to the principle at stake. Those questions call for assertions that may have more complexity in them than a definition does, that are falsifiable in different ways, and that open up a wider range of questions in reply. Propositions sprout implications, and those implications are what the questions go on to test.*

**Most claims are frail, the Socratic method makes use of that fact in an algorithmic way. 

---
Page: 227

*To review the sequence: Your partner has made a claim. Your goal is to test it. But you don’t want to do this in a confrontational way. You want to get your partner’s agreement to some other claim that can be brought into tension with the first one. That is our topic now: how to devise questions that can produce agreement and then put pressure on whatever claim has already been made.*

**When you get a person to disagree with himself it's felt more viscerally and the chances of him being transformed are higher. 

---
Page: 227

*You’re trying to show that the claim is inadequate, that it’s too simple, that the problem needs more analysis.
So you want to ask questions that have those effects. How do you come up with them on the spot? Below are some classic techniques for that purpose. All of them are versatile, though some are more useful for one kind of subject than for another. The questions don’t refute anything. They merely open lines of inquiry—but that’s the point. Socratic questions aren’t meant to settle things, though they may lead to settlement in due course. In themselves they tend to expose complexity.*

**What do you do if your partner is not having it? I.e. stops answering questions and don't want to participate. 

---
Page: 228

*Literalism. First, you can put pressure on a principle by taking it literally.
Think about cases that might be covered by the wording of the principle but that are outside its intent or that just don’t fit. Sometimes a principle is based on a mental picture of a core case but is expressed in words that also cover cases far afield. The need for narrower wording can be made obvious, and then saying something more specific may turn out to be hard. That is where the real action lies.*

**Force more clarity by showing how the principle can be misused. 

---
Page: 229

*Subtle metaphors are often embedded in words of that kind. The metaphors are attractive because they make abstract ideas easier to picture and understand. But metaphors are also a common way to hide analysis or avoid it. Taking a metaphor literally tends to make it dissolve. The conversation can then turn to the details where the work has to be done.*

**It's always about removing obstacles for getting to the core of issues. And looking back at your claims and see how congruent they are with the core. If they don't fit together, you've found an inconsistency and your brain will feel uncomfortable until it has figured out another claim that will fit better.

---
Page: 229

*Extremes. Think about extreme cases—that is, the outer limits of what the principle might cover. The model of an extreme case, for this purpose, is one most likely to be objectionable by every criteria other than the one covered by the principle. Sometimes such cases can be pulled from historical and literary sources.*

**If claims and principles don't deal with edge cases then it's clear that they're too frail. 

---
Page: 231

*Change the politics. People often announce principles that sound good to them but are unconsciously supported by politics in their examples of how the principle works. The support can fairly be described as unconscious because the holders don’t think that politics are relevant, but then they react differently when the politics are reversed. Or they react differently when the people in an example are made sympathetic or unsympathetic, or are members of their own group or members of a different group, etc. It’s good Socratic discipline, when thinking about what your friends do, to imagine it being done by your enemies, and to imagine what your enemies do as if it were done by your friends.*

**Does changing who enacts something change the conversation? If so, it's riddled with politics and if that's the case it's already on weak footing. Expose it.

---
Page: 232

*Change the perspective. A principle can be challenged by asking how it would look to someone in a different position. This is especially useful in conversations about ethics. When talking about what to do and how to live, it is tempting to take positions that are self-serving or short-sighted. Those tendencies can sometimes be overcome by looking at a case through the eyes of someone else or from a different point in time.*

**This is especially useful when examining yourself. It produces what's known as the Solomon effect.

---
Page: 233

*These kinds of questions can be productive when examining yourself.
In effect they ask for the usual Socratic consistency. But it’s not consistency between two different things you believe. It’s consistency between your answers to the same question when put to you from different points of view.
You’re comparing how a problem looks through the eyes of your current self to how it might look to future versions of yourself, to how it might look to others you admire and can imagine as onlookers, to how it might look to your skeptical enemies, or to how it might look if declared publicly, and so forth. If the answers aren’t consistent, they might need adjustment.*

**At the same time you don't want to change something purely on the basis of social pressure. You want to grab their truthful perspectives to inform you but not make you cower. 

---
Page: 237

*The last part of that example shows a step that can be valuable generally:
asking, in effect, what others would be willing to accept as evidence that they’re wrong, or what (if anything) might cause them to change their minds.*

**Kind of like an over-under. If it would be over, would you still believe X? 

---
Page: 238

*That example illustrates how one kind of question can lead to another. It begins by considering what incentives a rule might create (our current pattern); but that line gets countered by a question of the kind shown in the previous section: if the suggestion about incentives were right, what else would we expect to see—and do we see it? The illustration also shows how the flow of a dialogue can usefully be reversed. The party being questioned turns a Socratic question back at the questioner. The Socratic function can be alive and active on both sides of the conversation.*

**The more alive and active it is the sharper the effect. 

---
Page: 242

*Rules of engagement. Suppose, then, that you do want to adapt Socratic principles to settings that don’t lend themselves to Socratic dialogue as such. It is then useful to think of Socrates as providing not just rules for dialogue but more general rules of engagement.*

**Rules of engagement are useful for spreading company culture.

---
Page: 244

*11. Offense. Everyone tries to make claims in ways that do not give personal offense to their partners. Everyone tries to receive claims in ways that do not take offense from their partners. The giving or taking of offense is understood to be a serious threat to the process of getting anywhere in inquiry.*

**I like that it takes both the perspective of the speaker and the listener. I think that it's more common to take offense to what wasn't meant as offensive then people actually being offensive.

---
Page: 244

*10. Candor. Partners in inquiry say what they really think. They are not punished for it. Saying something unpopular is, to the contrary, considered admirable; even if it’s wrong, it is a service to the cause of getting closer to the truth. If someone is willing to incur a personal cost to put forward a perspective, that perspective is probably shared by others who do not want to bear the cost. It needs to be said so that it can be tested and determined to be true or false.*

**These rules of engagement are good rules for building psychological safety.

---
Page: 244

*12. Humility. Conclusions are provisional. They may seem very probable, so much so that they are well worth fighting for. But there is always a reserve of doubt, an awareness of one’s own ignorance and blind spots, and a recollection that others have been equally sure and have been wrong, over and over again. The result of all this is an attitude of humility at all times about how much you know and how sure you should be about it.*

**Being wrong and not knowing about it feels exactly like being right. Even if you do possess the current truth, it is provisional, deeper truths replace shallower ones and you can go infinitely deep.

---
Page: 245

*But of course the real question is what you want out of this conversation.
What is the purpose of it? Perhaps you are better off changing the subject or deferring the discussion to a time when your uncle is not arguing in front of an audience, or has had fewer drinks, or otherwise is more likely to be reasonable. And the same roughly goes for friends, or co-workers, or people you encounter online. You can only control what you do, not what they do.
So you have decisions to make about your ends and your means. Socrates has suggestions about both. They are great when everyone else will buy into them. They are often great even when everyone else won’t—but not necessarily. You have to think clearly about your goals and how you are trying to reach them. The general point: whether Socratic testing is suitable is a topic suitable for Socratic testing.*

**Not all conversations need to have a meaning or goal but when they do, don't you want to be able to have a conversation of the highest possible quality and usefulness?

---
Page: 247

*That is what a teacher of the Socratic school needs to cultivate:
knowledge and skill, by all means, but also a Socratic intensity of feeling.
You have to care feverishly yourself if you mean to inspire your students to care half that much. This becomes the subtext of every lesson taught, whatever the stated topic might be and whether or not it lends itself to questioning. Let the Socratic rules of engagement be felt as important. Let students see how the hemlock is administered in our times and regard it with contempt and disgust. Let them speak fearlessly and receive refutation the same way; let them listen fearlessly and without offense; let them prefer truth to all else. Let them see, above all, what it is for Socratic values to be not only understood and practiced but also loved.*

**A great leader and teacher is able to inspire love.
