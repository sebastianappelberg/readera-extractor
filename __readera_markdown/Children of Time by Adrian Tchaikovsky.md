*Alongside the Barrel was the Flask: the delivery system for the virus that would accelerate the monkeys along their way – they would stride, in a mere century or two, across physical and mental distances that had taken humanity millions of long and hostile years.*

**It's been five pages and already there's been four or five novel concepts. I like the idea of turbocharging evolution with genetic manipulation. And doing it by using a virus isn't so far off crispr.

Page: 21

*This is what a few tens of thousands of neurons can do: Portia has tried and failed, variation after variation, homing in on those that evinced the most response, and now she will go about things differently.*

**The flexibility of the computation of neurons is remarkable. How much of the actuation has been encoded in the genes, and how much is learnt?

**It's almost like a kinship string of iterations to tune a network. And they're different because the combination of circumstancial factors create a very specific basin of attraction.

*Eventually he is promoted from prey/not-prey to mate, because her behaviours are limited as regards males. After the act of mating, other instincts surface and their partnership comes to an end.
She lays her clutch, the many eggs of a very successful huntress.
Their children will be beautiful and brilliant and grow to twice her size, infected with the nanovirus that Portia and the male both carry. Further generations will be larger and brighter and more successful still, one after the other selectively evolving at a virally accelerated rate so that those best able to exploit this new advantage will dominate the gene pool of the future.
Portia’s children will inherit the world.*

**If we increased the effectiveness of evolution by 1%, how long would it take for that process to wipe out all previous iterations?

*Sleep for a long, lonely time. She would return to the tomb, and a simulacrum of herself would stand watch over a silent planet, in a silent universe, as the last outpost of the great spacefaring human civilization.*

**He seems to be reasonably good at epic prose.

Page: 40

*Portia and Bianca make automatic threats, lifting their forelimbs and displaying their fangs. Portia is considering whether her secret new weapon would even the odds. Her mind plays out likely scenarios, with and without the male’s assistance. The enemy numbers seem too great for her to be sure of victory, and her task comes first. In her mind is a meta-plan, just the sort of A-to-B route-finding that her distant antecedents performed, save that her goal is not just a spatial location but an intangible victory condition. A fight now with the Spitters would likely leave her in no position to achieve what she has set out to do.*

**This jives well with Levin's definition of intelligence. Getting from A to B in more and more intricate ways.

Page: 41

*And in looking beyond, too. Now she squats at the entrance to the makeshift tent forming their camp, Bianca and the male nestling beside her for warmth, and looks out through the gaps in the canopy at the lights populating the night sky. Her people know them and see paths and patterns in them and realize that they, too, move. Portia understands that their celestial journeys are predictable enough to use when navigating her own.
One, though, is special. One light does not tread a slow and year-long course over the heavens, but hurries past, a genuine traveller just as she is.
Portia looks up now and sees that tiny glint of reflected light passing overhead, a solitary motile speck in the vast dark, and she feels a kinship with it, lending to that orbiting pinpoint as much of an arachnomorphic personality as she can conceive of.*

**I wonder how many living things that are aware of the stars.

Page: 55

*Long ago in Portia’s evolutionary history, her species’ social development was greatly accelerated by a series of mutations in the reigning infection. The virus began to transcribe learned behaviour into the genome of sperm and egg, transforming acquired memes into genetically inheritable behaviour. The economic, force-evolved brains of Portia’s kind share more structural logic with each other than chance-derived human minds do. Mental pathways can be transcribed, reduced to genetic information, unpacked in the offspring and written as instinctive understanding – sometimes concrete skills and muscle memory, but more often whole tranches of knowledge, ragged-edged with loss of context, that the new-born will slowly come to terms with throughout its early life.*

**I wonder how much generational knowledge that's passed on between humans biologically. Not necessarily genetically but perhaps bioelectrically. 

---
Page: 58

*After they are done, each side weighing what it is willing to share against the relative bargaining power of the other party, Portia’s male scuttles onto the web and distils his Understanding of aphid husbandry into a neatly silk-wrapped packet of sperm. One of the local males performs a similar service with his own day-to-day knowledge of his family’s territory and its aggressive neighbours. This active use of the viral transcription is not behaviour prompted by the virus itself, but a cultural tradition amongst Portia’s people: information as currency, by means of a transfer that incidentally assists the virus in propagating its genetic code. At the same time, the next generation of spiderlings will share kinship, a bridge between Portia’s Great Nest and this little family, part of a great web of such interrelations whose connections can be traced, community to community, across much of the planet.*

**Knowledge itself gets the virality of the virus. I wonder how quickly all worlds knowledge would be shared among everyone if we had this kind of virus for real.

*‘Right. Gilgamesh has done his best to decode, based on the fragments in archive,’ Lain reported. ‘Everyone want to hear this?’ ‘Yes,’ Guyen decided.
What came to them from the ship’s speakers was hideous: a corroded, static-spiked mess in which a female voice could just be discerned, nothing but isolated words breaking in and out of the interference – words in a language that nobody but Holsten could comprehend.*

**It's weird that they seem to have pretty advanced computer on board but it can't do simple translations. 

---
Page: 79

*She knows that individual ants themselves cannot be treated with, communicated with or even threatened.
Her comprehension is coarse, of a necessity, but approximates to the truth.
Each ant does not think. It has a complex set of responses based on a wide range of stimuli, many of which are themselves chemical messages produced by other ants in response to still more eventualities. There is no intelligence within a colony, but there is such a hierarchy of interacting and co-dependent instinct that it seems to Portia that some manner of entity is behind a colony’s actions and reactions.*

**Each ant is like a neuron and together they form emergent complexity that is able to sustain itself. 

---
Page: 79

*Ant colonies evolve and adapt, throw up new castes, investigate and make use of resources, devise new technologies, refine them and interrelate them, and all this without anything approaching a consciousness to direct it. There is no hive mind, but there is a vast and flexible biological difference engine, a self-perfecting machine dedicated to the continuance of itself. It does not understand how what it does functions, but it constantly expands its behavioural repertoire and builds upon those trial-and-error paths that prove fruitful.
Portia’s understanding of all this is very limited, but she has a grasp of how ants do and do not work. She knows that individual ants cannot innovate, but that the colony can – in a strange way – make what appear to be informed decisions. Application of force and reward, a narrowing of the colony’s viable options so that the most advantageous is the one the spiders intend it to choose, can lead to a colony accepting boundaries on its territory and its place in the world, and even to become a productive partner. The colonies are perfect exponents of game theory: they will cooperate where that course is less costly and more beneficial than other strategies, such as all-out genocidal war.*

**Cognition is much more an abstract structure than a wetware phenomena. 

---
Page: 82

*Portia’s world – the underlying geology that existed before the terraforming – is rich in shallow deposits of metals, and the ants dig deep to build their nests. In this colony, centuries of burning has led to charcoal production, and occasional inadvertent smelting has been systematized into the forging of tools. The blind watchmaker has been busy.*

**His knowledge of evolution is quite apparent. 

---
Page: 99

*She may die, and her eyes look into that abyss and feed her with a terror of extinction, of un-being, that is perhaps the legacy of all life.*

**Are we a long line of genes just trying to outrun death? If we cure death, the race is over. 

---
Page: 101

*Her people have solved the mathematical riddles posed by the orbiting satellite – the Messenger, as they think of it – learning the proofs first by rote and then in true comprehension, as a civic and religious duty. The intrusion of this signal has seized the attention of much of the species in a relatively short period of time, because of their inherent curiosity. Here is something demonstrably from beyond, and it fascinates them; it tells them that there is more to the world than they can grasp; it guides their thinking in new ways. The beauty of the maths promises a universe of wonders if they can but stretch out their minds that bit further: a jump they can almost, but not quite, make.*

**It's the wonders of the world that opens up our minds. There's no math without wanting to understand the world. 

---
Page: 103

*Some of the scouts reach the foot of Seven Trees, despite the bombardment. But, after a metre or so of bare trunk, each tree boasts sheer web skirts that angle up and out, a surface that the ants cannot get purchase on. They climb and fall, climb and fall, initially mindless in their persistence. Then a sufficient concentration of messaging scent builds, and they change their tactics, climbing up over one another to form a living, reaching structure that extends blindly upwards.*

**Ants could be seen as an agential material. It's material with complex behavior that generates emergent behavior as its combined in great numbers and face complex situations. 

---
Page: 110

*We don’t have a culture. We don’t have a hierarchy.
We simply have a crew, for life’s sake. Guyen, who someone once considered fit to command a large spaceship, is now titular head of the human race.’ ‘It’s the way it’s got to be,’ Lain replied stubbornly.
‘Scoles disagrees. I reckon the army will disagree too, if Karst is stupid enough to start waking people up and putting guns in their hands. You know what’s a good lesson of history? You’re screwed if you can’t pay the army.
And we don’t even have an economy. What could we give them, as soon as they realize what’s going on. Where’s the chain of command? What authority does anyone have? And once they’ve got guns, and a clear indication of where they might wake up next, why should we ever expect them to go back to the chambers and sleep? The only currency we have is freedom, and it’s plain that Guyen’s not going to be handing that out.’*

**I wonder how this has played out in actual history. Has there been wars lost due to the incentives of the army being lost?

---
Page: 177

*Anyway, the airborne vibrations grew fewer and fewer during the thing’s captivity, and eventually it ceased to make them. Some suggested this meant the creature had grown content with its captivity.
Two generations after it was taken, when the events surrounding its arrival had already passed into something resembling theology, one attendant noticed that the giant was moving its extremities, the deft sub-legs that it used to manipulate objects, in a manner imitative of palp-signalling, as though it was trying to mimic the basic visual speech of the spiders.*

**What utter desperation to be caught by something so alien and then studied until your death. 

---
Page: 197

*Everything that Portia has tried has so far failed, and none of her fellows has obtained any better results. She is beginning to drift into ever more speculative sciences, desperate for that one lateral thought that will save her civilization from a collapse into dispersed barbarism.
She has now been working in her laboratory for the best part of a day.
Fabian has departed with a new batch of solutions to pass to his counterparts within the sealed lazar-houses that the dwellings of infected peer groups have become. She has no particular belief that these solutions will work. She feels she has reached the end of her capabilities, frustrated with the great void of ignorance that she has found, while standing out here at the very edge of her people’s comprehension.*

**Our lack of wisdom never feels so bad as when your life depends on it. 

---
Page: 214

*This is another great advance that Portia’s society is built on, and yet one that has become a serious limiter of their further advancement. There are hundreds of tamed ant colonies within Great Nest, not counting those in the surrounds that undertake the day-to-day business of producing food, clearing ground or fending off incursions of wild species. Each colony has been carefully trained, by subtle manipulation of punishment, reward and chemical stimulus, to perform a specific service, giving the great minds of the spiders access to a curious kind of analytical engine, using the cascading decision trees of the colony’s own governance as gearing. Each colony is good for a very limited set of related calculations – a vastly skilled yet vastly specialized idiot savant – and retraining a community of ants is a long and painstaking task.*

**The ant colonies essentially work like narrow AI for the spiders. 

---
Page: 215

*Viola has uncovered the secret language of Understandings – if it could only be translated.
That is the sticking point. Viola knows enough to state confidently that what her ants can sequence from biopsy samples is the hidden book that resides within each and every spider, but she cannot read it.
However, her ants have a final gift for Portia. There is a passage, in the book of the spiderlings retrieved by Fabian, which is new. Ants of another of Viola’s colonies have been trained to compare these hidden books and highlight differences. The same paragraph, never before seen, turns up in each of the three immune infants. This, Viola hypothesizes, may represent their Understanding of how to ward off the plague.*

**I love this wording of genetics. 

---
Page: 222

*They were part of a species that had become unmoored from time, only their personal clocks left with any meaning for them while the rest of the universe turned to its own rhythms and cared nothing for whether they lived or died.*

**Hibernation and the universe overall forces you to rethink something as fundamental as time. 

---
Page: 225

*It is not Portia herself who first grasps the wider import of her cure. It is hard to say which scientist was first to the mark: it is one of those ideas that seems simultaneously to be everywhere, exciting every enquiring mind.
Portia’s treatment has allowed living adult spiders to benefit from a foreign Understanding. Yes, what was transferred was an immunity, but surely the process would work with other Understandings, if they can only be separated out and their page noted in Viola’s great book of the body. No longer will the spread of knowledge be held down by the slow march of generations or by laborious teaching.*

**How far can we go in changing our own biology while we're alive? We have several vaccines that adds protection against disease. Can we do other fun stuff?

---
Page: 226

*From there on, any spider may learn anything. Every scientist of Portia’s generation and beyond will stand on the shoulders of the giants that she chooses to reside within her. What one knows, any can know, for a price. An economy of modular, tradable knowledge will swiftly develop.
But that is not all.
After she is recovered, Portia presents Bianca to the Temple. She explains about her fellow’s contribution to the cure. Bianca is permitted to address the assembled priestesses.
There has been a shift of orthodoxy in the wake of the plague. Everyone is having to stretch their minds to fill the gaping void left by all those who did not survive. Old ideas are being revisited, old prohibitions reconsidered.
There is a great feeling of destiny, but it is a self-made destiny. They have passed the test. They are their own saviours. They wish to communicate something to that one point of intellect outside their sphere: the most basic, essential signal.
They wish to tell the Messenger, We are here.*

**A brief description of the Renaissance.

*The Sentry Pod would begin developing a means of communication, starting with the simplest binary notation and using each stage to bootstrap up to a more complex language, just as if a computer was being programmed from scratch. It would take time, depending on the willingness and ability of the monkeys to learn, generation to generation.*

**Is this a realistic method of establishing a shared language? 

---
Page: 229

*Yet those troubling half-dreams recurred to her. In her dream there had come a primitive boat of travellers claiming to be her kin, but she had looked at them and seen them for what they truly were. She had scanned through their histories and their understandings. They were the mould that had grown on the corpse of her own people. They were hopelessly corrupted with the same sickness that had killed Kern’s own civilization.
Better to start anew with monkeys.*

**She successfully gives off a vibe that she is from another cultural era.

Page: 237

*It had all been handled so swiftly and confidently that only right at the end did he realize that he had been kidnapped: wrested from one faction by another. At once, everything became worse than he had thought. The Gilgamesh was not just crawling with crazy descendants of awoken cargo, but they had already begun fighting each other. It was the curse of the Old Empire, that division of man against man that was the continual brake on human progress.*

**Is human progress not in part due to our rivalry? An enlightened species ought to be able to transcend it, to go beyond rivalrous dynamics. 

---
Page: 246

*The Messenger was the last survivor of an earlier age of the universe, they were told. In the final throes of that age, it was the Messenger who was chosen to come to this world and engender life out of the barren earth. The Messenger – the Goddess of the green planet – remade the world so that it would give rise to that life, next seeded it with plants and trees, and then with the lesser animals. On the last day of the previous age, at the apex of creation, the Messenger dispatched Portia’s distant ancestors to this world, and settled back to await their voices.*

**What if we have some ancestors out there that are just waiting for us to grow up?

---
Page: 250

*It is the age-old limiting factor: the ants are slow. The scientific endeavour of each spider nest rests on its ability to train its ant colonies to perform needed tasks: manufacturing, engineering, analysis. Whilst each generation has become more adept, pushing the boundaries of their organic technology, each fresh task requires a new colony, or else for a colony’s existing behaviour to be overwritten. Spiders like Fabian create chemical texts that give an ant colony its purpose, its complex cascade of instinct that allows it to perform the given task. Although in truth there are few like Fabian, who accomplishes more, more elegantly and in less time, than any other.*

**Pretty cool description of a biological computer programmer. 

---
Page: 255

*Bianca seems sad. And now they prevent us from being all that we could be, she suggests. And that is at the heart of me. If I were to cut myself away from it, there would be nothing left of me. I do not just feel Temple is mistaken, I believe that Temple has become a burden. And you know that I am not alone. You will have spoken with the temples in other cities – even those cities that Great Nest is hostile to. You know that others feel as I do.
And they will be punished, in turn, Portia tells her. As will you.*

**Orthodoxy will cause stagnation which will cause extinction.

Page: 264

*They are like us, and you know it. You cannot know what they might have achieved if they had been allowed to live and to prosper.
For a moment she does not even know what he means, but she sees his mind is still focused on that detritus of doomed males whose lives will take them no further than the foot of the trees.
They are of no value or worth.
But you cannot know that. There could be a dozen geniuses dying every day, who have never had an opportunity to demonstrate their aptitude. They think, as we do. They plan and hope and fear. Merely see them and that connection would strum between you. They are my brothers. No less so, they are yours.
Portia disagrees vehemently. If they were of any quality or calibre, then they would ascend by their own virtues.
Not if there was no structure that they could possibly climb. Not if all the structure that exists was designed to disenfranchise them. Portia, I could have been killed. You yourself said it. I could have been taken by some starving female, and nothing in that would be seen as wrong, save that it might anger you.*

**Humanist thought seems to be a natural thought that comes up at a certain level of progress. 

---
Page: 266

*The brake will come off the advancement of their species. You have this Understanding, now?
I do. The primary architecture is actually surprisingly simple. Building complex things out of simple things is the basis of the idea. It’s like building a web. I also have a system for constructing any secondary architecture, fit for any task required. It is like a language, a concise mathematical language.*

**As most things in nature, it could only be that the complex is built up out of the simple. 

---
Page: 282

*And yet it seems that building the future is never so simple. Each thread always leads to another, and there is no easy way to stop spinning.*

**Continuously using metaphors that makes sense for spiders adds a nice layer to the language.

Page: 290

*The nanovirus in him resists the necessity of what he intends, recognizing the sibling strains in his potential victims.
His plan is delicately balanced, however, and he cannot let anything endanger it.*

**At what level of cognition do you gain the capacity to do stuff that's purely bad for the gene pool?

---
Page: 290

*From there on, the Great Nest column is doomed. Fabian’s soldiers eat it from the inside out. The invading army has some defences, pre-set conditioning to defend itself against unexpected attack, plus shifting scent codes that change in a prearranged sequence over time. But Fabian’s new architecture allows him to shift swiftly to adapt. The lumbering composite engine that is the Great Nest army has detected that something is going wrong, but it simply cannot adjust quickly enough to understand the threat.*

**The way that our code is written today is more like the Great Nest's old and static way of doing it. It's not adaptive by default. 

---
Page: 293

*I realized that half the people doing the work had been born outside suspension. I’d taken up peoples’ whole lives, Mason – they’d been trying to make it work for that long. And the new generation . .
. they didn’t know as much. They had learned what they could but . . . and then came another generation, devolving, understanding less than before.
Everyone was too busy doing the work to pass on the knowledge. They knew nothing but the ship, and me. I had to lead them because they had work to do, no matter how inferior they were, how much longer it would take.’*

**Knowledge in a population can decrease exponentially. 

---
Page: 302

*Radio . . . ? And then Fabian is lost briefly in a dream of science, where every ant soldier could be fitted with a radio receiver, and somehow could write its own chemical architecture according to the urgings of signals sent out over that invisible web. A colony of ants that could be orchestrated swift as thought . . . ? He trembles at the thought. What could we not do?
And it nags at him, and nags at him, that he has come across such a thought before. And with a sudden jolt, he realizes that the great project of the Messenger, which Portia and her fellow zealots have given their all to realize – the indirect cause of this war – could itself be just such a thing. No ants, no chemicals, but that net of copper would carry impulses just as the radio would, just as the individual ants in a colony would. And were there not switches, forks, gates of logic . . . ? It seems to him that such a design would have the virtue of speed, yet surely it could not be as versatile and complex as an ant colony working at full efficiency?*

**We have the right communications infrastructure but we don't have flexible enough machines to command. To be able to give high-level instructions to natural problem solvers would be incredibly potent. 

---
Page: 303

*Fabian wishes things could be different, but he can plot no path from where he stands now, to any outcome that would see him reconciled with Portia.*

**Is there always a path of peace given enough knowledge and wisdom or are there cases that are impossible to handle peacefully?

---
Page: 305

*The irony is that in now taking a layman’s view of the instructions, some progress is being made that the faithful might never have achieved with their more doctrinal approach.*

**It's the ebbs and flows between generalists and specialists that create disruptions needed for insight. 

---
Page: 314

*She has a rare perspective that enables her to look back on so many generations of struggle and growth and be able to give a shape and a texture to history, to appreciate the incremental contributions of all those Portias and Biancas and, yes, Fabians down through the generations. Each has contributed Understandings to the sum total of arachnid knowledge. Each has been a node in the expanding web of progress. Each has planned out the path one step beyond their ancestors. In a very real way, Bianca is their child, the product of their learning, daring, discovery and sacrifice. Her mind throngs with the living learning of dead ancestors.
She understands, in a real and immediate way, how she stands on the backs of giants, and that her own back, too, will be strong enough to bear the weight of many generations to come.*

**If we could improve knowledge transfer between generations that would make us quite a lot faster and able to go further. Though is there a danger in being too good at spreading current knowledge? What if it creates basins of attractions that makes paradigm shifts less frequent?

---
Page: 321

*What happened? he was asking himself frantically. Lain was working to contain the Guyen infection. There was nothing I could do. I had to go back to sleep, in the end. So how did it come to this? He felt that he was developing some hitherto unknown ailment, some equivalent of motion sickness caught from too many dissociated moments of history crammed into too little personal time.*

**I wonder what the psychological protocols would have to be. It feels like your brain would definitely have a hard time dealing with a reality that's temporally out of whack. 

---
Page: 326

*That the Messenger is an entity of great breadth of intellect, she cannot contest. Potentially it is a superior intellect, but that is a harder judgement to make because she can only conclude that it is a very different type of intelligence from her own. There is plainly a vast amount that the Messenger takes for granted which even Bianca, stretch her mind as she might, cannot grasp. Conversely, there is much that has been said to the Messenger that has evidently been misunderstood, or met with blank incomprehension on the part of God. The capabilities of the divine are apparently limited in curious ways. There are concepts that the most ignorant spiderling would intuitively understand that clearly pass the Messenger by.*

**Would a higher intelligence be able to understand us completely? We cannot fully understand any other life on earth, not even the simplest possible organism. And that life is less intelligent than us, so the only case we have is where a higher intelligence does not in the least understand the lower intelligence. 

---
Page: 335

*She sees them now, yes. She sees them for what they are.
They are Earth. Their form does not matter.
They are her children.
She backtracks, calling up logs of centuries of conversations from where they are crammed into her electronic memories, having overwritten all the last desperate radio songs of old Earth. She reviews all the baffling mystery of the monkey dialogues now seen under a harsh and uncompromising new light. She stops trying to tell them things, and starts listening.*

**It's funny how knowing the form of what you're communicating with is such a huge unlock in understanding.  

---
Page: 346

*‘Listen, Holsten, you’re going back under as soon as they find you a chamber, right? You’re priority, fuck all the rest. There are some perks to being me right now, and first off is that I call the shots. You go under. You wake up when we hit the green planet system. You make planetfall, and you make sure everything is done to make that place ours, come crazy computers or monster spiders or whatever. And you make it somewhere she can live. You hear me, old man?’ ‘But you—’ ‘No, Holsten, this thing you get to take responsibility for. I’ll have done all I can. I’ll have done everything humanly possible to bring about this tomorrow. It’ll be down to you after that.’ Only later, after she saw him to his newly restored suspension chamber, did he glimpse the name still tagged on the ragged shawl of shipsuit she wore about her shoulders. The sight of it froze him just as he was about to get a leg up into the refurbished coffin. Really? For all this time? Facing that long, cold oblivion, with no certainty that he would wake up again, it was curiously warming to know that someone, even if it was this cynical bitter woman, had been holding a torch for him all those unfelt years.*

**There's a special kind of reward for having fought hard to fix everything. The price is that you're worn out.

Page: 354

*Despite their chemical expertise, the spiders have a limited ability to produce combustion-based rockets, hence the entire Sky Nest/Star Nest project. Kern and her people never considered this, but life on the green planet is young by geological standards – too young to have produced anything in the way of fossil fuels. Biotechnology and mechanical ingenuity have had to take up the slack.*

**There has to be other such limiters on technology. All the geological timescale processes feels hard to harness as terraforming technology. 

---
Page: 357

*For now that the Messenger has found the patience and perspective to properly understand Her children, She can finally communicate Her warning in a way they can understand. At last the spiders appreciate that, even aside from their orbiting God, they are not alone in the universe, and that this is not a good thing.*

**Scarcity makes the world a dangerous place. 

---
Page: 372

*She had racked her piecemeal recollection of her species’ history and found only a hierarchy of destruction: of her species devastating the fauna of planet Earth, and then turning on its own sibling offshoots, and then at last, when no other suitable adversaries remained, tearing at itself.
Mankind brooks no competitors, She has explained to them – not even its own reflection.*

**I get the need for drama but the way we've destroyed others is through superior collaboration, we are a collaborative species above all else. 

---
Page: 379

*The place he ended up in had been a storeroom, he guessed. Now they stored only one thing there: a single suspension chamber. At the foot of the pedestal was a huddle of little objects – icons heat-moulded in plastic into an approximation of the female form: offerings from her surrogate children, and their children, to the guardian-mother of the human race. Above that desperate little display of hope and faith were tacked little scraps of cloth torn from shipsuits, each bearing some close-written message. This was a shrine to a living goddess.*

**Over the course of just a few hundred pages we got to witness a normal woman turn into a goddess through sheer will and determination to keep life itself going. 

---
Page: 401

*Portia cannot know that her adversaries inside the ship have improvised an electromagnetic pulse to attack the spiders’ electronics.
The two technologies have passed each other in the night, barely touching.
Even Portia’s radio is biological. What little the pulse can touch of it is instantly replaced; the technology is mortal, born to die, and so every component has replacements growing behind it like shark’s teeth.*

**Karl Friston talks about mortal engines, I wonder how closely related hist notion is to this. 

---
Page: 433

*Both species have limits they cannot easily cross: mental, physical, sensory. That is why they need each other.*

**Another intelligent species would be extremely useful in understanding reality deeper.
