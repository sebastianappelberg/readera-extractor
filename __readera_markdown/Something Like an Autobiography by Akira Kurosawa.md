*So, for my first two years of primary school, life was a hellish punishment. It’s a terrible thing to make retarded children go to school simply because some rule says they should. Children come in many varieties. Some five-year-olds have the intelligence of a child of seven, and, conversely, there are seven-year-olds who have not surpassed the average child of five. Intelligence develops at differing rates. It’s a mistake to decree that a year’s progress must take place within exactly one year, no more and no less.*

**Being held back or moved up should be more common perhaps? It's true that development in children seems to happen in paradigmshifts.

*my brother appeared. He came rowing up to me in a boat and offered me a ride. Rejoicing, I reached out my hand and let him pull me up into the boat. As soon as I was on board, he began rowing vigorously out toward the middle of the river. Just when the flag and the reed blinds of the poolside hut began to look very small, he suddenly pushed me into the river.
I flailed with all my strength to keep afloat and reach the boat with my brother in it. But as soon as I came close, he rowed away from me. After he repeated this action several times, my strength drained from me. When I could no longer see the boat or my brother and had already sunk below the surface, he grabbed me by my loincloth and pulled me up into the boat.
Shaken and surprised, I found there was nothing wrong with me except that I had swallowed a little water. As I sat gasping and wide-eyed, my brother said, “So you can swim after all, Akira.” And sure enough, after that I wasn’t afraid of the water any more. I learned to swim, and I learned to love swimming.*

**Brotherly love is partly about pushing each other to the limit.

*Little Big Sister was the prettiest of my three sisters who lived at home, and she was almost too gentle and kind. Her beauty was something of a glass-like transparency, delicate and fragile, offering no resistance. When my brother fell off the balance beams and injured his head at school, it was this sister who sobbed and said she wanted to die in his place. Even as I write about her now, my eyes burn with tears and I keep having to blow my nose.*

**His feelings are apparent on the page.

*The day her funeral was held, the whole family and all our relatives gathered at the main hall of the Buddhist temple to listen to the priests recite sutras. When the recitation became quite noisy, as they all chimed in with the wooden drum and the gong sounding, I suddenly broke into peals of laughter. Much as my father, mother and sisters glared at me, I couldn’t stop laughing. My brother led me outside, still laughing. I was prepared for a terrific scolding. But my brother did not seem in the least angry. Nor did he leave me out in front and return to the ceremony in the main hall as I expected him to do. Instead, he turned and looked back toward the loud proceedings and said, “Akira, let’s get farther away.” He set out briskly across the paving stones toward the temple gate.
As he forged ahead, he spat out the word “Idiotic!” and I was happy. The reason I had started laughing was that I felt the same way. To me, the whole thing was absurdly funny. When I heard my brother’s opinion, I felt relieved. I wondered if my sister would be at all consoled by that ceremony in the main hall. She died at the age of sixteen. For some strange reason, I remember the Buddhist name she received after death in its entirety: To Rin Tei Kō Shin Nyo. (“Peach Forest Righteous Sunbeam Sincerity Woman”).*

**Death itself is unfathomable, our rituals are absurd.

*The latter trip was my own choice. Mr. Tachikawa had left Kuroda Primary School, but Uekusa and I continued to visit him at his home. We passed many a fulfilling day in the atmosphere of free education and respect for individuality he created, and the warm hospitality his wife provided. No matter what my other duties, I was unable to forgo these precious hours.*

**Fulfilling moments are worth everything, they raise your spirit and get you closer to your true self.

*My mother’s strength lay particularly in her endurance. I remember an amazing example. It happened when she was deep-frying tempura in the kitchen one day. The oil in the pot caught fire. Before it could ignite anything else, she proceeded to pick up the pot with both hands—while her eyebrows and eyelashes were singed to crinkled wisps—walk calmly across the tatami-mat room, properly put on her clogs at the garden door and carry the flaming pot out to the center of the garden to set it down.
Afterward the doctor arrived, used pincers to peel away the blackened skin and applied medication to her charred hands. I could hardly bear to watch. But my mother’s facial expression never betrayed the slightest tremor. Nearly a month passed before she was able to grasp something in her bandaged hands.*

**There's a certain stoic strength to japanese women.

*From the foot of Ishikiribashi bridge, as I approached my house along the Edogawa River, the morning sun at last came up and shone full in my face. Every time the sun shone on me in the morning, I couldn’t help thinking that from that moment on my day would begin to be like that of an ordinary child. But it wasn’t out of discontent that this feeling came to me; it was a sense of self-sufficiency and satisfaction.*

**What a way to set yourself apart early.

*I think this was the first time I ever experienced the savagery that lies in the human heart. I could never find pleasure studying under this teacher. But I acquired a determination to work so hard that this teacher would never be able to criticize me again.*

**Antagonists makes the protagonists stronger by forcing them to rise to the occasion.

*(As I have been writing about my bundled up kendō outfit and my high wooden clogs, I have had a sudden realization. Without knowing it at the time, it was these objects from my past that I employed in my first film, Sugata Sanshirō [1943] as visual devices showing Sanshirō’s new dedication to a life of judo. Perhaps it is the power of memory that gives rise to the power of imagination.)*

**Every artist has a touch of their past in their work.

*I believe that the people of the Meiji era were like those described by contemporary novelist Shiba Ryotaro in his Saka no ue no kumo (Clouds over the Hill). They lived their lives as if their sights were set on the clouds beyond the hill they were climbing.*

**I get this feeling sometimes, you have your eyes fixed on the goal 100 years ahead. It improves longterm thinking at the expense of appreciating the present.

*These lost sounds are all impossible to separate from my boyhood memories. And all are related to the seasons. They are cold, warm, hot or cool sounds. And they are allied with many different kinds of feelings. Happy sounds, lonely sounds, sad sounds and fearful sounds. I hate fires, so the sound of the fire alarm and the fire-watchman’s voice and drum shouting out the location of the fire were sounds that struck me with terror. “Bong, bong! Fire in Kanda district, Jinbōchō’.” At such noises I burrowed down under the covers and tried to make myself small.*

**Sounds like the world was more lively back then. Today all I hear is the sound of motorways. 

---
Page: 61

*If I were to continue enumerating the somewhat sad childhood recollections that arise from sound stimuli, there would be no end to it. But as I sit here and write about these childhood sounds, the noises that assail my ears are the television, the heater and the sound truck offering toilet paper in exchange for old newspapers; all are electrical sounds. Children of today probably won’t be able to fashion very rich memories from these sounds. Perhaps they are more to be pitied than even that freshwater-clam seller’s child.*

**Our soundscape has suffered more than our environment. It's lifeless and industrial.

*When someone is told over and over again that he’s no good at something, he loses more and more confidence and eventually does become poor at it. Conversely, if he’s told he’s good at something, his confidence builds and he actually becomes better at it. While a person is born with strengths and weaknesses as part of his heredity, they can be greatly altered by later influences.*

**The key is to gradually build up your own self efficacy.

*The morning tram was always full. Clumps of people always overflowed from the entrance where the conductor’s stand was and hung precariously from the side of the car. One day I too was hanging there on the way from Omagari to Iidabashi, when suddenly I decided that everything in life was stupid, boring and futile. I let go of the hand rail.*

**I wonder if creative minds have an easier time to let go of the habits that usually controls us.

*THE GREAT KANTŌ EARTHQUAKE was a terrifying experience for me, and also an extremely important one. Through it I learned not only of the extraordinary powers of nature, but extraordinary things that lie in human hearts. To begin with, the earthquake overwhelmed me by suddenly transforming my surroundings.*

**I wonder if the earthquakes have something to do with Japan's inclination towards nature worshipping.

*But there was an even more ridiculous incident. They told us not to drink the water from one of our neighborhood wells. The reason was that the wall surrounding the well had some kind of strange notation written on it in white chalk. This was supposedly a Korean code indication that the well water had been poisoned. I was flabbergasted. The truth was that the strange notation was a scribble I myself had written. Seeing adults behaving like this, I couldn’t help shaking my head and wondering what human beings are all about.*

**Being exposed to how little adults know is an important rite of passage for a child.

*This little story has its charm and doesn’t really hurt anyone. What is frightening is the ability of fear to drive people off the course of human behavior. By the time the fires downtown had subsided, everyone had used up all the household candles and the world was plunged into the real darkness of night. People who felt threatened by this darkness became the prey of the most horrifying demagogues and engaged in the most incredibly reckless, lawless acts. It’s impossible even to imagine the magnitude of the terror brought by total darkness to people who have never experienced it before—it is a terror that destroys all reason. When a person can’t see anything to the left or the right, he becomes thoroughly demoralized and confused. And, as the old saying goes, “Fear peoples the darkness with monsters.”
The massacre of Korean residents of Tokyo that took place on the heels of the Great Kanto Earthquake was brought on by demagogues who deftly exploited people’s fear of the darkness. With my own eyes I saw a mob of adults with contorted faces rushing like an avalanche in confusion, yelling, “This way!” “No, that way!” They were chasing a bearded man, thinking someone with so much facial hair could not be Japanese.*

**Will we be able to solve our slavery to fear? I've heard of communities where they practice disaster responses together and it's incredibly effective. Can we do that at scale? Our brains are incredibly plastic and so is our culture, but do we have any control of it at scale?

*I wrote that the Sumidagawa was dyed red, but it wasn’t a blood red. It was the same kind of light brownish red as the rest of the landscape, a red muddied with white like the eye of a rotten fish. The corpses floating in the river were all swollen to the bursting point, and all had their anuses open like big fish mouths. Even babies still tied on their mothers’ backs looked like this. And all of them moved softly in unison on the waves of the river.
As far as the eye could see there was not a living soul. The only living things in this landscape were my brother and I. To me we seemed as small as two beans in all this vastness. Or else we too were dead and were standing at the gates of hell.*

**There are great scenes of beauty that have a common awe to them. Then there are hellscapes that have a common despair to them.

*The night we returned from the horrifying excursion I was fully prepared to be unable to sleep, or to have terrible nightmares if I did. But no sooner had I laid my head on the pillow than it was morning. I had slept like a log, and I couldn’t remember anything frightening from my dreams. This seemed so strange to me that I asked my brother how it could have come about. “If you shut your eyes to a frightening sight, you end up being frightened. If you look at everything straight on, there is nothing to be afraid of.” Looking back on that excursion now, I realize that it must have been horrifying for my brother too. It had been an expedition to conquer fear.*

**Fear takes hold of you by paralyzing by forcing you to avert your gaze. Looking at it straight, you realize it can't touch you.

*As if Japan weren’t small enough to begin with, I fail to understand why it is necessary to think of it in even smaller units. No matter where I go in the world, although I can’t speak any foreign language, I don’t feel out of place. I think of the earth as my home. If everyone thought this way, people might notice just how foolish international friction is, and they would put an end to it. We are, after all, at a point where it is almost narrow-minded to think merely in geocentric terms. Human beings have launched satellites into outer space, and yet they still grovel on earth looking at their own feet like wild dogs. What is to become of our planet?*

**We need sociotechnologies that categorize us less, that blurs boundaries between groups.

*Nature takes good care of her appearance. What makes nature ugly is the behavior of human beings.*

**Meadow flowers are beautiful, so organic and full of energy.

*Once when I visited a farmer’s house, he served me a vegetable dish with miso bean-paste sauce cooked in clamshells—a style called kaiyaki in this part of the country—and fish. While he drank saké over his meal, he said to me in thick dialect, “You might wonder what could be interesting about living in a hovel like this and eating slop like this. Well, I tell you, it’s interesting just to be alive.”
In any case, what I heard and saw of the way people lived in Toyokawa Village fifty years ago was surprisingly simple and almost sadly peaceful. As I recall it now, the memories of this place fade into the distance like a village seen from a train window, growing smaller and hazier.*

**His way of writing is simple and clear. Not articulate but beautiful and strangely vivid.

*It was summer, so we usually ate our outdoor meals in a cool forest. First we’d find two Y-shaped branches and stick them into the ground. Then we’d lay a crosspiece on them, hang the pot on it and build a fire underneath. The pot was cast iron, but inside it were big clamshells with miso sauce for cooking the fish in kaiyaki style. The fish were mostly varieties of carp. We would add local herbs and vegetables that grew wild. We ate with chopsticks made from whittled branches, and our meals were indescribably delicious.*

**It feels like we as humans are missing out when we don't ever eat in nature.

*They all replied that no one knew because no one had ever been there. “Well, then I’ll go take a look,” I said. They all looked horrified and urged me to give up the idea—after all, no adult had ever been there, so it must be really dangerous, they insisted. At this resistance my stubbornness grew and I felt I absolutely had to go.*

**I wonder what this rebellious nature in some humans comes from. It does seem to serve a purpose in the sense of pushing boundaries.

*ORDINARILY, children are supposed to spend their childhood like saplings sheltered in a greenhouse. Even if on occasion some wind or rain of the real world slips in through the cracks, a child is not supposed to be weatherbeaten in earnest by the sleet and snow. I, too, spent such a sheltered childhood, and the only time I really experienced the wind of life was in the Great Kanto Earthquake. Events like the First World War and the Russian revolution and the transitions and upheavals in Japanese society during those years were things I only heard about, like the wind and rain outside my greenhouse. When I graduated from middle school, it was as if I had been planted outdoors for the first time. I began to feel the wind and rain of world events on my own skin.*

**I like the setup of this metaphor.

*THE YEAR I turned eighteen, 1928, saw the mass arrest of Communist Party members in the “3–15 Incident” and the assassination of the Manchurian warlord Chang Tso-lin by Japanese Army officers. The following year brought the worldwide economic panic. As the winds of the Great Depression blew across a Japan shaken to the very foundations of her economy, proletarian movements sprang up everywhere, including the field of fine art. At the other extreme was an art movement that advocated escape from the painful realities of the hard times, something that was called, in a sort of pidgin, “eroguro nan-sensu” (“erotic-grotesque nonsense”).*

**It feels like we're coming back full circle. Economy is getting worse and tension is rising. For them it took 11 years after noticing that the economy was bleak until all hell broke loose. Are we looking at world War in 2030?

*In matters of both film and literature I owe much to my brother’s discernment. I took special care to see every film my brother recommended. As far back as elementary school I walked all the way to Asakusa to see a movie he had said was good. I don’t remember what it was that I saw in Asakusa, but I do remember that it was at the Opera Theater. I remember waiting in line for discount tickets for the late show, and I remember my brother getting a terrific scolding from my father when we got home.*

**Influencing each other's taste and style is quite a lovely thing.

Page: 138

*The space was tiny. At first I couldn’t understand why my brother, with his income, would live in a place like this. But as the days went by, I began to appreciate the special qualities of this life-style.
Some of the people who lived in this neighborhood were construction workers, carpenters, plasterers and the like. But the majority of the residents had no visible means of support and no definable profession. Yet somehow they shared and depended on each other to such a degree that what should have been a terribly difficult life became surprisingly optimistic and, at every opportunity, downright humorous.*

**Community matters more than affluence. 

---
Page: 140

*The change was very gradual, and coincided with my discovery that the bright, cheerful humor of tenement life I enjoyed so much harbored in its shadows a dark reality. This is probably true of human life everywhere—a light exterior hides a dark underside. But I was seeing it for the first time, and I was forced to think about it.
Ugly things happened here, as they did everywhere else. An old man raped his little granddaughter. A woman caused a great disturbance throughout the tenements with her suicide threats every night. One night, after trying to hang herself and being laughed at by everyone in the neighborhood, she quietly jumped into the well and drowned.*

**What is the nature of the darkness that accumulates under the surface? Likewise the light? Is there a right balance? What could we do with the right knowledge? Can knowledge solve everything? Perhaps but sometimes it's so out of reach that you'd need a thousand more generations before a problem is even tractable, what do you do then?

*Looking in through the window of the rooms next to hers, sure enough I saw the child tied to a post with a man’s kimono sash. The window was open, so, like a thief, I climbed into a stranger’s house. I rushed to untie the sash that bound the girl to the post. But she glared at me with furious eyes. “What do you think you’re doing? No one asked for your help!” I stared at her in surprise. “If I’m not tied up when she comes back, she’ll torture me again.” I felt as if I had been slapped in the face. Even if she was untied, she couldn’t escape from the environment that bound her to that post. For her, other people’s sympathy was of no value at all. Pity was only a source of more trouble. “Hurry and tie me up again,” she said with so much ferocity I thought she might bite me. I did as she told me. It served me right.*

**What would be the right thing to do in this case? You'd need to bring down the system and change the environment for that child. 

---
Page: 141

*Why would a stepmother be cruel to her stepchild? That her behavior toward a child would be motivated by her hatred for her husband’s previous wife doesn’t make sense. The only explanation for this kind of crime is ignorance. But ignorance is a kind of insanity in the human animal. People who delight in torturing defenseless children or tiny creatures are in reality insane. The terrible thing is that people who are madmen in private may wear a totally bland and innocent expression in public.*

**This behavior is not restricted to stepmothers. 

---
Page: 145

*Then one day my mother said to me, “I wonder if Heigo is all right.” “What do you mean?” I asked. She explained her misgivings: “Hasn’t Heigo always said he would die before he reached the age of thirty?” What she said was true. My brother had always said that. He claimed that when human beings lived past thirty, all they did was become uglier and meaner, so he had no intention of doing so.*

**You can't judge life by how optimally in shape you are. You have a role to play for as long as you muster an effort. People who have experience but no future in competing with the best are great sources of knowledge and service. 

---
Page: 148

*But he went on to say that our appearance was exactly the same, but that my brother had had a kind of dark shadow in his facial expression and that his personality, too, had seemed clouded. Musei felt that my personality and face were, by contrast, sunny and cheerful.
Uekusa Keinosuke has also said my personality is like that of a sunflower, so there must be some truth to the allegation that I am more sanguine than my brother was. But I prefer to think of my brother as a negative strip of film that led to my own development as a positive image.*

**If there's a shared space of possibility then occupying the dark parts is the same as pushing others into the light. Reminds me a bit of Scarface. Proximity has to be a great decider whether you share possibility space.

Page: 150

*Through all of this my father did not let me loose to spin on my own. He just kept telling me, as I became more and more panicky, “Don’t panic. There’s nothing to get excited about.” He told me if I would just wait calmly, my road in life would open up to me of its own accord. I don’t know exactly what kind of viewpoint led him to tell me such things; perhaps he was speaking from his own experience of life. As it turned out, his words proved amazingly accurate.*

**Kind of a non-objective search attitude. 

---
Page: 149

*In other words, I did not—and still don’t—have a completely personal, distinctive, way of looking at things.
This discovery did not surprise me unduly. To develop a personal vision isn’t easy. But when I was a young man, this insufficiency caused me not only dissatisfaction but uneasiness. I felt I had to fashion my own way of seeing, and I became more impatient. Every exhibition I went to seemed to prove to me that every painter in Japan had his own personal style and his own personal vision. I became more and more irritated with myself.
As I look back on the art scene, it’s clear to me that very few of the painters whose work I saw really had a personal style and vision. Most of them were just showing off with a lot of forced techniques, and the result was mere eccentricity. I don’t recall who wrote it, but there was a song about someone who is unable to state outright that what is red is red; the years go by, and it is not until his old age that he finally becomes certain. And that’s just how it is. During youth the desire for self-expression is so overpowering that most people end up by losing all grasp on their real selves. I was no exception. I strained to perform technical tours de force as I painted, and the resulting pictures revealed my distaste for myself.*

**I've always felt this is important to me as well. To be original. Maybe the very act of grasping for it moves it further away?

---
Page: 153

*AS I WRITE this, I can’t help thinking how very strange it all was. It was chance that led me to walk along the road to P.C.L. and, in so doing, the road to becoming a film director, yet somehow everything that I had done prior to that seemed to point to it as an inevitability. I had dabbled eagerly in painting, literature, theater, music and other arts and stuffed my head full of all the things that come together in the art of the film. Yet I had never noticed that cinema was the one field where I would be required to make use of all I had learned. I can’t help wondering what fate had prepared me so well for this road I was to take in life. All I can say is that the preparation was totally unconscious on my part.*

**What are my areas of expertise and where could they all come together as one?

---
Page: 154

*As an aspiring painter, I decided to draw a contrast between the bleak industrial area and the gaudy dressing room of a revue backstage, showing the laborer’s life-style in black and the dancer’s in pink. That’s how I started my story, but I don’t remember the rest of it.*

**These are the things that are interesting to know. What contrasts there and how they're made.

---
Page: 156

*I listened to them, took a second assignment and ended up working for Yama-san. They had been right. I learned there are many kinds of films and many kinds of directors. The work in the Yamamoto “group” was fun. I didn’t want to work for anyone else after that. It was like the wind in a mountain pass blowing across my face. By this I mean that wonderfully refreshing wind you feel after a painfully hard climb. The breath of that wind tells you you are reaching the pass. Then you stand in the pass and look down over the panorama it opens up. When I stood behind Yama-san in his director’s chair next to the camera, I felt my heart swell with that same feeling—“I’ve made it at last.” The work he was doing was the kind that I really wanted to do. I was standing in the mountain pass, and the view that opened up before me on the other side revealed a single straight road.*

**I would like to have more world experiences that I've thought deeply about, experiences that can help me explain the world.

Page: 159

*Management theory at P.C.L. regarded the assistant directors as cadets who would later become managers and directors. They were therefore required to gain a thorough mastery of every field necessary to the production of a film. We had to help in the developing laboratory, carry a bag of nails, a hammer and a level from our belts and help with scriptwriting and editing as well. We even had to appear as extras in place of actors and do the accounts for location shooting.*

**I like this holistic approach to teaching. 

---
Page: 164

*His motive in drawing in the grain was to make Yama-san’s work look just that much better. Probably he felt that in order to continue to merit Yama-san’s confidence, he had to make this extra effort. The confidence Yama-san had in us created this attitude. And of course this attitude carried over into our own work.
I was one of those whose attitude toward work was shaped by Yama-san’s confidence. When I advanced to chief assistant director, this combined with my natural stubbornness to form an extraordinary tenacity.*

**Trust is a powerful motivator. 

---
Page: 167

*Yet the same Yama-san who educated us in this exceptional manner made the following claim in a magazine once: “All I ever taught Kurosawa was how to drink.” How is it possible to express one’s gratitude to someone so selfless? I learned so much about movies and the work of being a movie director from Yama-san that I couldn’t begin to describe it all here. He was without question the best of teachers. The best proof of this lies in the fact that none of the work of his “disciples” (Yama-san hated this term) resembles his. He made sure to do nothing to restrict his assistant directors, but rather encouraged their individual qualities to grow. He managed to do this without any of the stiffness associated with the image of “teacher.”*

**Helping others transform and transcend is akin to being a spiritual leader.

*Anyone can criticize. But no ordinary talent can justify his criticism with concrete suggestions that really improve something.*

**I'll bring this with me for code reviews.

---
Page: 172

*From this point on, my approach to literature changed. I made a deliberate effort to change it. I began to read carefully, asking myself what the author was trying to say and how he was trying to express it. I thought while I read, and at the same time I kept notes on the passages that struck some emotional chord in me or that I considered for some reason important. When I reread in this new way things I had read in the past, I realized how superficial my initial reading had been.*

**The reading mindset you have is essential to getting what you need from a text.

*Mono-no-aware, “sadness at the fleeting nature of things,” like the sweet, nostalgic sorrow of watching the cherry blossoms fall*

**The Japanese are especially good at capturing this in all their art. 

---
Page: 175

*In order to give us experience with directing actors, Yama-san often had assistant directors take charge of second-unit shooting. Sometimes he would even shoot a scene up to a certain point and then go home, leaving the rest in our hands. If you don’t have a tremendous amount of faith in your assistant directors, you can’t do a thing like that. On the other hand, from our point of view as assistant directors, it was a heavy responsibility. If we didn’t rise to the occasion, we would lose not only Yama-san’s trust, but the confidence of the cast and crew as well. We had to do our utmost. I’m sure Yama-san was well aware of our position and was off somewhere having a drink with a grand smirk on his face. But these experiences, which were like unannounced examinations in school, provided the best possible opportunity for us to develop our directing ability.*

**Finding spots where you can throw your disciples into the deep end should be a great joy to a teacher, since it's the place where the student can integrate and grow the most. 

---
Page: 177

*Aside from this, there are three very important things I learned from Yama-san about actors. The first is that people do not know themselves. They can’t look objectively at their own speech and movement habits. The second is that when a movement is made consciously, it will be the consciousness rather than the movement that draws attention on the screen. The third is that when you explain to an actor what he should do, you must also make him understand why he should do it that way—that is, what the internal motivations in the role and the action are.*

**I wonder how many small unconscious movements make up  how actions are perceived on screen. 

---
Page: 178

*Yama-san seemed to enjoy surprising us, so he took care not to let us know what he was doing. Then he would gleefully surprise us with an extraordinary combination of sound effects and music. The sound powerfully altered the visual image to create a whole new impression, and at these moments we forgot all our pain and exhaustion in the excitement of it.
It was still the very beginning of the sound-film era in Japan. I don’t believe many other directors had thought about the relationship between sound and image so deeply as to realize that they were mutual multipliers.*

**The best directors of the modern age all have great taste when it comes to sound and music. 

---
Page: 181

*I have a distaste for argumentation, and I can’t stand people who spout all kinds of strung-together logic. One argumentative screenwriter used some syllogistic reasoning to prove to me that his script was right. I became annoyed and countered that, no matter how logically he defended it, what was dull was still dull, so forget it. We fought.*

**I would like to have more conflicts about the things that I'm passionate about and skilled at.

*When I had drunk up all my money, I sat down at my desk again and began to write. What I wrote was in the main for money*

*There is nothing more dangerous than a worthless bureaucrat who has fallen prey to the trends of the times. In the Nazi era, of course, Hitler was a madman, but if you consider people like Himmler and Eichmann behind him, you understand that it is in the subordinate positions that the geniuses of horror and insanity appear. When it comes down to the level of the jailers and operators of the concentration camps, you find beasts that exceed the power of the imagination to conceive.*

**A very insightful observation. Followers of mad men are a step above them in insanity.

*So at least in a way I owe the start of my career as a director to the wife of the author of the novel Sugata Sanshirō. But in the course of my work as a film director, whenever my fate has hung in the balance, some kind of guardian angel has always appeared out of nowhere. I myself can’t help being surprised by this strange destiny. This fate nudged me into my first experience as a fledgling movie director.*

**In a way you rig the game by doing a thousand small things where one of those small things pays off big.

*Once I looked at the production from the director’s viewpoint, however, I saw everything I had been unable to see as an assistant director, or even as a second-unit director. I understood the subtle difference between the positions. When you are creating your own work, it is entirely different from when you are helping with someone else’s. Moreover, when you are directing your own script, you understand the script better than anyone else possibly can.*

**I think I'm such a control freak that for me to truly care about what I'm building, I need to be in charge of every part of it. I think the director's job seems lovely. A thing I've had to learn is to be okay with asking people to do things.

*When you are working under difficult conditions, you experience one hour’s labor as two or three. But hard work just makes you feel you’ve put in more time than you have. Reality remains reality: An hour is only an hour. Since this experience, whenever I am working under adverse conditions and feel, through exhaustion, that what I have must be enough, I force myself to go on and produce three times as much. If I do that, I finally get what I really need. It was the bitter experience in the wind of Sugata Sanshirō that taught me this.*

**Should be a good rule of thumb for any work where you're gathering something.

*I like unformed characters. This may be because, no matter how old I get, I am still unformed myself; in any case, it is in watching someone unformed enter the path to perfection that my fascination knows no bounds. For this reason, beginners often appear as main characters in my films, and Sugata Sanshirō is just such a one. He is unformed, but he is made of superior material.*

**I believe we all feel unformed in a sense.

*In later years when I asked the ones who quit what their reasons were, they all denied that my demands on them had had anything to do with it. In fact, they said that working on my film had been their first opportunity to return to being ordinary women, following the same path ordinary women do, casting off the various dead layers of skin that had clung to them as actresses. But in their protestations I heard much that was meant to keep my feelings from being hurt. The truth of the matter is, I am sure, that the severity of the work I put them through was one of the primary causes of their decision to give up acting.*

**Sometimes followers turn into cannon fodder for leaders.

*My proposal went something like this: “It looks as if we are going to lose the war, and if it comes to the point of the Honorable Death of the Hundred Million, we all have to die anyway. It’s probably not a bad idea to find out what married life is like before that happens.”*

**Proposals seemed simpler and more accepted back then. They carry too much connotations right now.

*The Japanese see self-assertion as immoral and self-sacrifice as the sensible course to take in life. We were accustomed to this teaching and had never thought to question it.*

**I wonder what's best for the group? Does narcissism give better results even for the group or is radical self-sacrifice better?

*The Japanese have rare talents. In the midst of the war it was the encouragement of the militarist national policies that led us to a fuller appreciation of traditions and arts, but this political sponsorship is not necessary. I think Japan can be proud at any time of having a very special esthetic world of its own. This recognition led me also to a better understanding of myself—and greater self-confidence.*

**To find, nurture and love what's unique about your own culture seems like a good source of meaning and purpose.

*No Regrets for Our Youth was born in the midst of these great upheavals. I felt peculiarly deep emotions about this film, the first to be made in the post-war atmosphere of freedom. The locations we used in the old capital of Kyoto—the grassy hills, the flower-lined side streets, the brooks reflecting the sun’s rays—are all employed in the most trivial films today, but at that time they had special meaning for us. For me it was as if my heart could dance, as if I had grown wings and could fly among the clouds.*

**Aesthetic elements that we take for granted today had to be born at some point. All art evolves.

*First of all, the only ideas we had to go on for the Silver Mountains script were that it should be a manly sort of action film and, since Sen-chan was a mountain man, we should use an alpine location.
Sen-chan and I sat for three days glaring at each other across a writing table, but came up with nothing very inspiring. Finally, deciding there was no way out of it but a frontal attack, I wrote out something like a newspaper headline: “Three Bank Robbers Escape to Mountains of Nagano Prefecture; Investigation Headquarters Moves to Base of Japan Alps.” Then I had the three robbers hide out in the snows of the Japan Alps, sent a police inspector after them, and, adding in Sen-chan’s mountaineering experiences and general knowledge, we wrote a little every day. At the end of three weeks we had a complete script for To the End of the Silver Mountains, with a story that was not bad at all.*

**You're fluent in your medium when you can bruteforce something decent into existence.

*To investigate these questions, I decided to set my film in a black-market district and make the hero a gangster who has charge of that particular territory. In order to bring his personality into high relief, I decided to pit another character against him. At first I thought I would make this antagonist a young humanist doctor who was just setting up his practice in the area. But no matter how hard Uekusa and I worked at it, we couldn’t bring this idealized doctor to life—he was so perfect that he had no vitality. The gangster figure, on the other hand, had become almost real enough to breathe; his every move reeked of flesh and blood. This immediacy arose from the fact that he was based on a real-life model, whom Uekusa was meeting with regularly. Uekusa was, in fact, becoming so immersed in the gangsters’ way of life, so absorbed in and sympathetic toward the underworld, that he and I later quarreled over it.*

**It makes sense to setup a feedback loop with reality to breath life into characters. There'd be a kind of back and forth between developing the character in your mind and on a paper with the real-life inspiration for it.

*But at some point in the writing of every script I feel like giving the whole thing up. From my many experiences of writing screenplays, however, I have learned something: If I hold fast in the face of this blankness and despair, adopting the tactic of Bodhidharma, the founder of the Zen sect, who glared at the wall that stood in his way until his legs became useless, a path will open up.
On this occasion, too, I made up my mind to endure it.*

**Hard yet solveable problems may require some staring at it until it's fully settled in the back of your mind.

*The marionette-like young doctor who was the picture of humanitarianism was blown to bits. At last the “Drunken Angel” came on stage. The character immediately took on life and breath and began to move. He was a man past his mid-fifties, an alcoholic doctor with his own clinic. Turning his back on fame and fortune, he settled among the common people. As a physician, he went after tangible results with extreme obstinacy, and this stubborn character of his won him popularity. He always had a straggly three-day beard, his hair was always a mess and he would always retort in a dangerously blunt fashion to those who spoke to him arrogantly, but behind this careless exterior he harbored an honest and superior heart.*

**Sounds a bit like House and Sherlock, though their hearts are ultimately not good.

*I am not a special person. I am not especially strong; I am not especially gifted. I simply do not like to show my weakness, and I hate to lose, so I am a person who tries hard. That’s all there is to me.*

*And yet a film director can rejoice over a marvelous asset only to have it turn into a terrible burden. If I let Mifune in his role of the gangster become too attractive, the balance with his adversary, the doctor, played by Shimura Takashi, would be destroyed. If this should occur, the result would be a distortion of the film’s overall structure. Yet to suppress Mifune’s attractiveness at the blossoming point of his career because of the need for balance in the structure of my film would be a waste. And in fact Mifune’s attraction was something his innate and powerful personal qualities pushed unwittingly to the fore; there was no way to prevent him from emerging as too attractive on the screen other than keeping him off the screen. I was caught in a real dilemma. Mifune’s attractiveness gave me joy and pain at the same time.*

**The way that the parts come together is just as important as the quality of the individual parts.

*I had calculated a counterpoint effect from contrasting the images of this sequence with “The Cuckoo Waltz,” but I had not measured the actual length of either. I could not understand what had made their timing coincide. I wonder if it could have been that when I heard this music blaring at me after my father’s death in the course of experiencing feelings very similar to those of the gangster in my film, I unconsciously registered its exact length in my brain.
Subsequent to this “Cuckoo Waltz” incident, the same kind of thing happened to me many times. It seems that, no matter what is happening to me in my personal life, I am always thinking about my work without even knowing it. This phenomenon resembles some kind of karma. In fact, my having become a film director, and having persevered in this profession thus far, really must be either a reward or a punishment for something I did in a former life.*

**Subconsciousness is not to be underestimated, especially not in masters.

*We are still crying with the pain of these old wounds. But for the management there was nothing painful or even irritating about these experiences. They never recognized that movies are made by a cooperative work force that is created by a union of individual human talents. They never recognized how much effort was required to bring about that union. So they were able to destroy with total equanimity everything we had worked to build. We became like the children in Buddhist limbo who have preceded their parents in death: On the banks of the River Sai they pile up stones to form little towers. But every time a tower is completed, a mean devil comes and knocks it down. It was like Sisyphus trying to push his boulder up the mountain.*

**There is sense in having an organ that makes decisions regardless of the pain caused by them, they're useful when safeguarding higher priorities.

*We had no alternative but to hand over the studio to the company management.
Several hours after our removal from the studio grounds, we received permission to re-enter. The only indication of change was a single signboard with a court order posted on it. Nothing appeared to be missing or altered, and yet we sensed that something was no longer there. What had vanished was the feeling of devotion we had once had toward the studio.
October 19, 1948, the Third Toho Strike came to an end. As autumn deepened, the dispute that had begun in the springtime was dissipated by the cold wind blowing through the studio. The emptiness we felt was neither sadness nor loneliness; it was like a shrug of the shoulders and a “See if I care.” I was determined to do as I had said, and not work with those two men again. I had come to understand that the studio I had thought was my home actually belonged to strangers. I went out of the gate with the intention never to return. I had had enough of piling up stones on the banks of the River Sai.*

*Today, no matter how moving a scene is, no matter how stunning the actors’ performances are, I can watch with total calm collectedness. But there is something a little bit sad about this ability. The reason we could do a scene like the climax of The Quiet Duel and get so excited and involved in what we were doing is because Mifune, Sengoku and I were all young. If we were told to do that scene over again today, we couldn’t. It is the recognition of this fact that makes The Quiet Duel a picture for which I feel a great nostalgia.*

**Inexperience is a beautiful thing and the more you grasp after it the further away it gets as experience can only accumulate.

*It was actually at that point, with the firing of those young assistant directors, that the Japanese film industry began its decline. If young people are not trained and fed in to replenish the reservoir of high spirits, the natural aging process inevitably leads to a loss of strength. This is true in any enterprise. I don’t know if the older people stayed on in the movie industry because young people weren’t trained, or if young people weren’t trained because the older ones were staying on. In any event, no one took the responsibility for training young people.*

*I DON’T REALLY like talking about my films. Everything I want to say is in the film itself; for me to say anything more is, as the proverb goes, like “drawing legs on a picture of a snake.” But from time to time an idea I thought I had conveyed in the film does not seem to have been generally understood. On these occasions I do feel an urge to talk about my work. Nevertheless, I try not to. If what I have said in my film is true, someone will understand.*

**A reasonable argument for not publishing analysises of your own art.

*When I filmed this sequence and edited it according to the passage of chronological time, the effect was terrible. As an introduction to a drama it was slow, the focus was vague and it failed to grip the viewer.
Troubled, I went back to look at the way I had begun the novel. I had written as follows: “It was the hottest day of that entire summer.” Immediately I thought, “That’s it.” I used a shot of a dog with its tongue hanging out, panting. Then the narration begins, “It was unbearably hot that day.” After a sign on a door indicating “Police Headquarters, First Division,” I proceeded to the interior. The chief of the First Detective Division glares up from his desk. “What? Your pistol was stolen?” Before him stands the contrite young detective who is the hero of the story. This new way of editing the opening sequence gave me a very short piece of film, but it was extremely effective in drawing the viewer suddenly into the heart of the drama.*

**The obvious way to lay out a story is seldom the clearest or most beautiful way.

*On the grounds there was a small apartment-house kind of building, so we all moved in there and used it as a dormitory. We worked without respite or distractions.
It was midsummer when we filmed Stray Dog. When the day’s work ended around five o’clock, the sun was still beating down. Even after we finished supper it was still light outside. Right after the war, even if you went into the center of town (from Oizumi that meant going to the Ikebukuro district), there was not much to do. We ended up killing time waiting for dark and the hour to return to the dormitory. More often than not someone would say, “Why don’t we do a little more work?” We ended up spending a great many evenings on the set.*

**What sense if camaraderie and purpose they all must've had.

Page: 296

*At any rate, the filming of Stray Dog went remarkably well, and we finished ahead of schedule. The excellent pace of the shooting and the good feeling of the crew working together can be sensed in the completed film.
I remember how it was on Saturday nights when we boarded a bus to go home for a day off after a full week’s hard work. Everyone was happy. At the time I was living in Komae, far out of the city near the Tamagawa River, so toward the end of the ride I was always left alone. The solitary last rider on the cavernous empty bus, I always felt more loneliness at being separated from my crew than I did joy at being reunited with my family.
Now the pleasure in the work we experienced on Stray Dog seems like a distant dream. The films an audience really enjoys are the ones that were enjoyable in the making. Yet pleasure in the work can’t be achieved unless you know you have put all of your strength into it and have done your best to make it come alive. A film made in this spirit reveals the hearts of the crew.*

**It's easy to forget all the hard work that is behind the scenes of a great film.

**I wonder if you have to love what your work more than your family in order to become one of the greatest.

*Characters in a film have their own existence. The filmmaker has no freedom. If he insists on his authority and is allowed to manipulate his characters like puppets, the film loses its vitality. From the moment this Hiruta appeared, the pen I was using to write the screenplay seemed almost bewitched. It wrote on, detailing Hiruta’s actions and words as if of its own accord. I had written many scripts, but this was the first time such a thing happened to me. I didn’t think about the circumstances in which Hiruta lived; the pen just glided on and described his poverty and shame. As this happened, the character of Hiruta quite naturally took over the film and nudged the hero aside. Even as I observed what was happening and knew it was wrong, I could do nothing to stop it.*

*Human beings are unable to be honest with themselves about themselves. They cannot talk about themselves without embellishing. This script portrays such human beings—the kind who cannot survive without lies to make them feel they are better people than they really are. It even shows this sinful need for flattering falsehood going beyond the grave—even the character who dies cannot give up his lies when he speaks to the living through a medium. Egoism is a sin the human being carries with him from birth; it is the most difficult to redeem. This film is like a strange picture scroll that is unrolled and displayed by the ego. You say that you can’t understand this script at all, but that is because the human heart itself is impossible to understand. If you focus on the impossibility of truly understanding human psychology and read the script one more time, I think you will grasp the point of it.*

**Perhaps there are cases where the only intelligible version of a story is where a large part of it has unintelligible parts?

*Often after supper we climbed up Mount Wakakusa and formed a circle to dance in the moonlight. I was still young and the cast members were even younger and bursting with energy. We carried out our work with enthusiasm.
When the location moved from the Nara Mountains to the Komyoji temple forest in Kyoto, it was Gion Festival time. The sultry summer sun hit with full force, but even though some members of my crew succumbed to heat stroke, our work pace never flagged. Every afternoon we pushed through without even stopping for a single swallow of water. When work was over, on the way back to the inn we stopped at a beer hall in Kyoto’s downtown Shijo-Kawaramachi district. There each of us downed about four of the biggest mugs of draft beer they had. But we ate dinner without any alcohol and, upon finishing, split up to go about our private affairs. Then at ten o’clock we’d gather again and pour whiskey down our throats with a vengeance. Every morning we were up bright and clear-headed to do our sweat-drenched work.*

**What kind of person do you need to be in order to ask people to give you their all? You need to know why you're doing what you're doing, and you need to know what you want them to do. You need to appreciate them and you need to care for their growth. You can't just scream, work hard and be a shithead when things don't go the way you think they should be.

*“To be honest with you, at the outset we were very disturbed when you went about cutting down the temple trees as if they belonged to you. But in the end we were won over by your wholehearted enthusiasm. ‘Show the audience something good.’ This was the focus of all your energies, and you forgot yourselves. Until I had the chance to watch you, I had no idea that the making of a movie was a crystallization of such effort. I was very deeply impressed.”
The abbot finished and set a folding fan before me. In commemoration of our filming, he had written on the fan three characters forming a Chinese poem: “Benefit All Mankind.” I was left speechless.*

**I guess this was his why. It doesn't always have to be revolutionary, but it has to be enough that it could move people's hearts.

*But it may be just as well to stop. I am a maker of films; films are my true medium. I think that to learn what became of me after Rashōmon the most reasonable procedure would be to look for me in the characters in the films I made after Rashōmon. Although human beings are incapable of talking about themselves with total honesty, it is much harder to avoid the truth while pretending to be other people. They often reveal much about themselves in a very straightforward way. I am certain that I did. There is nothing that says more about its creator than the work itself.*

**Maybe one of the best ways to find your true self is through creation? Your reflection in the art may be closer to the truth than your real self.

*I have never taken on a project offered to me by a producer or a production company. My films emerge from my own desire to say a particular thing at a particular time. The root of any film project for me is this inner need to express something. What nurtures this root and makes it grow into a tree is the script. What makes the tree bear flowers and fruit is the directing.*

**It is a fine thing to have developed to process for expressing yourself creatively. 

---
Page: 319

*This process is similar to that of a pot being fired in a kiln. Ashes and other particles can fall onto the melted glaze during the firing and cause unpredictable but beautiful results. Similarly unplanned but interesting effects arise in the course of directing a movie, so I call them “kiln changes.”*

**I suppose these parts are extra beautiful to the creator since it's like he gets to be the audience of something grown out of his work.

*A GOOD STRUCTURE for a screenplay is that of the symphony, with its three or four movements and differing tempos. Or one can use the Noh play with its three-part structure: jo (introduction), ha (destruction) and kyu (haste). If you devote yourself fully to Noh and gain something good from this, it will emerge naturally in your films. The Noh is a truly unique art form that exists nowhere else in the world. I think the Kabuki, which imitates it, is a sterile flower. But in a screenplay, I think the symphonic structure is the easiest for people of today to understand.*

**Structure can honestly make movies too predictable sometimes.

*DURING THE SHOOTING of a scene the director’s eye has to catch even the minutest detail. But this does not mean glaring concentratedly at the set. While the cameras are rolling, I rarely look directly at the actors, but focus my gaze somewhere else. By doing this I sense instantly when something isn’t right. Watching something does not mean fixing your gaze on it, but being aware of it in a natural way. I believe this is what the medieval Noh playwright and theorist Zeami meant by “watching with a detached gaze.”*

**He is somewhat explaining how to be aware of it all, not tunnelvisioning in on one thing.
