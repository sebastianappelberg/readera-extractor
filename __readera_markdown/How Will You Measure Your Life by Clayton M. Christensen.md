*A good theory doesn’t change its mind: it doesn’t apply only to some companies or people, and not to others. It is a general statement of what causes what, and why.*

**David Deutsch would say this is to do with the reach of the explanatory power of the theory.

*People often think that the best way to predict the future is by collecting as much data as possible before making a decision. But this is like driving a car looking only at the rearview mirror—because data is only available about the past.
Indeed, while experiences and information can be good teachers, there are many times in life where we simply cannot afford to learn on the job. You don’t want to have to go through multiple marriages to learn how to be a good spouse. Or wait until your last child has grown to master parenthood. This is why theory can be so valuable: it can explain what will happen, even before you experience it.*

**This goes to show that collecting information is not enough, you need to integrate it as well. You need to use the information to create a principled approach to your life.

*These theories are powerful tools. I have applied many of them in my own life; others I wish I’d had available to me when I was younger, struggling with a problem. You’ll see that without theory, we’re at sea without a sextant. If we can’t see beyond what’s close by, we’re relying on chance—on the currents of life—to guide us. Good theory helps people steer to good decisions—not just in business, but in life, too.*

**Polishing your inner compass is worthwhile, especially if you want to navigate uncharted territories. Though I have to say that the compass answer is a little bit of the same as a quick fix, "tune your compass and everything will work out". I don't think that's what the author means, I think he really does understand that the hard work cannot be skipped.

*A strategy? At a basic level, a strategy is what you want to achieve and how you will get there.*

**I like this very basic definition of a strategy.

*One of the best ways to probe whether you can trust the advice that a theory is offering you is to look for anomalies—something that the theory cannot explain. Remember our story about birds, feathers, and flight? The early aviators might have seen some warning signs in their rudimentary analysis of flight had they examined what their beliefs or theories could not explain. Ostriches have wings and feathers but can’t fly. Bats have wings but no feathers, and they are great fliers. And flying squirrels have neither wings nor feathers … and they get by.*

**He is a great storyteller, he weaves in very foundational scientific principles seamlessly.

*But incentives are not the same as motivation. True motivation is getting people to do something because they want to do it. This type of motivation continues, in good times and in bad.*

**What would I like to contribute to, even without getting a huge payoff?

*This is an important insight from Herzberg’s research: if you instantly improve the hygiene factors of your job, you’re not going to suddenly love it. At best, you just won’t hate it anymore. The opposite of job dissatisfaction isn’t job satisfaction, but rather an absence of job dissatisfaction. They’re not the same thing at all. It is important to address hygiene factors such as a safe and comfortable working environment, relationship with managers and colleagues, enough money to look after your family—if you don’t have these things, you’ll experience dissatisfaction with your work. But these alone won’t do anything to make you love your job—they will just stop you from hating it.*

**What should one call these nonobvious false opposites? I see them from time to time and they're usually a signal of insight.

*Motivation factors include challenging work, recognition, responsibility, and personal growth. Feelings that you are making a meaningful contribution to work arise from intrinsic conditions of the work itself. Motivation is much less about external prodding or stimulation, and much more about what’s inside of you, and inside of your work.*

**To be honest, you can have all these but still be unmotivated.

---
Page: 37

*The theory of motivation suggests you need to ask yourself a different set of questions than most of us are used to asking. Is this work meaningful to me? Is this job going to give me a chance to develop? Am I going to learn new things? Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement? Am I going to be given responsibility? These are the things that will truly motivate you. Once you get this right, the more measurable aspects of your job will fade in importance.*

**I would like to know more about each motivating factor. Is purpose as important as learning? Do you need all of them or just a few? What does each look like more concretely? Does something abstract like impact count as recognition?

*In our lives and in our careers, whether we are aware of it or not, we are constantly navigating a path by deciding between our deliberate strategies and the unanticipated alternatives that emerge. Each approach is vying for our minds and our hearts, making its best case to become our actual strategy. Neither is inherently better or worse; rather, which you should choose depends on where you are on the journey. Understanding this—that strategy is made up of these two disparate elements, and that your circumstances dictate which approach is best—will better enable you to sort through the choices that your career will constantly present.
If you have found an outlet in your career that provides both the requisite hygiene factors and motivators, then a deliberate approach makes sense. Your aspirations should be clear, and you know from your present experience that they are worth striving for. Rather than worrying about adjusting to unexpected opportunities, your frame of mind should be focused on how best to achieve the goals you have deliberately set.
But if you haven’t reached the point of finding a career that does this for you, then, like a new company finding its way, you need to be emergent. This is another way of saying that if you are in these circumstances, experiment in life. As you learn from each experience, adjust. Then iterate quickly. Keep going through this process until your strategy begins to click.*

**A bad mistake is to tough it out with a deliberate strategy in a  place that has already proven itself to not be it. 

---
Page: 43

*As you go through your career, you will begin to find the areas of work you love and in which you will shine; you will, hopefully, find a field where you can maximize the motivators and satisfy the hygiene factors. But it’s rarely a case of sitting in an ivory tower and thinking through the problem until the answer pops into your head. Strategy almost always emerges from a combination of deliberate and unanticipated opportunities. What’s important is to get out there and try stuff until you learn where your talents, interests, and priorities begin to pay off. When you find out what really works for you, then it’s time to flip from an emergent strategy to a deliberate one.*

**Iteration truly is the way to go to solve problems. How long should each iteration be? How different should they be from each other? How does one make sure that the search actually converges?

*Before you take a job, carefully list what things others are going to need to do or to deliver in order for you to successfully achieve what you hope to do. Ask yourself: “What are the assumptions that have to prove true in order for me to be able to succeed in this assignment?” List them. Are they within your control?
Equally important, ask yourself what assumptions have to prove true for you to be happy in the choice you are contemplating. Are you basing your position on extrinsic or intrinsic motivators? Why do you think this is going to be something you enjoy doing? What evidence do you have? Every time you consider a career move, keep thinking about the most important assumptions that have to prove true, and how you can swiftly and inexpensively test if they are valid. Make sure you are being realistic about the path ahead of you.*

**I think the process itself can be quite mechanical. Take some time to list all your options, list what's good about them, rank them in some order, list all assumptions, then go out and validate the assumptions ruthlessly. Ask someone who works with X. Create a quick prototype. Roleplay. Do some reading. And so on. Doing it too mechanically will kind of kill the emergent part though. Perhaps you can sprinkle in some random opportunities to counter that? 

---
Page: 52

*Once you understand the concept of emergent and deliberate strategy, you’ll know that if you’ve yet to find something that really works in your career, expecting to have a clear vision of where your life will take you is just wasting time. Even worse, it may actually close your mind to unexpected opportunities. While you are still figuring out your career, you should keep the aperture of your life wide open. Depending on your particular circumstances, you should be prepared to experiment with different opportunities, ready to pivot, and continue to adjust your strategy until you find what it is that both satisfies the hygiene factors and gives you all the motivators. Only then does a deliberate strategy make sense. When you get it right, you’ll know.
As difficult as it may seem, you’ve got to be honest with yourself about this whole process. Change can often be difficult, and it will probably seem easier to just stick with what you are already doing. That thinking can be dangerous. You’re only kicking the can down the road, and you risk waking up one day, years later, looking into the mirror, asking yourself: “What am I doing with my life?”*

**The only thing I know for sure is that I need to keep looking. 

**How should one budget for taking risks?

Page: 54

*You can talk all you want about having a strategy for your life, understanding motivation, and balancing aspirations with unanticipated opportunities. But ultimately, this means nothing if you do not align those with where you actually expend your time, money, and energy.
In other words, how you allocate your resources is where the rubber meets the road.
Real strategy—in companies and in our lives—is created through hundreds of everyday decisions about where we spend our resources. As you’re living your life from day to day, how do you make sure you’re heading in the right direction? Watch where your resources flow. If they’re not supporting the strategy you’ve decided upon, then you’re not implementing that strategy at all.*

**How do you spend resources when you don't know what to spend on it? It feels better to just save up. What I must realize is that the opportunity cost is greater than the material cost. And make many small bets. What's a small bet? What causes analysis paralysis?

---
Page: 56

*The decision that the SonoSite case describes introduces the last component in the strategy process: resource allocation. In the prior chapter, we introduced the idea that we decide between deliberate plans and emergent alternatives. In this chapter, we dive much more deeply into this—because in the strategy process, resource allocation is where the rubber meets the road. The resource allocation process determines which deliberate and emergent initiatives get funded and implemented, and which are denied resources. Everything related to strategy inside a company is only intent until it gets to the resource allocation stage. A company’s vision, plans, and opportunities—and all of its threats and problems—all want priority, vying against one another to become the actual strategy the company implements.*

**For individuals, time is probably the biggest resource decision. What do I spend my time on? I've already shifted a lot. It would be even more interesting to start spending money as well. What I need is a container of potential that I can pour effort into.

*Management kept telling everyone—press, employees, and shareholders—how important it was. But on the front lines, the senior management’s sense of what the market wanted made little sense to the troops. Engineers seemed more interested in dreaming up new ideas than finishing what had already been promised for Copland. Without Jobs, individuals were able to get away with spending their time on ideas they were excited about, regardless of whether they matched the company’s goals.*

**People in Steve's orbit had had to be quite large forces in and of themselves. Then you pull away their sun, of course, chaos is the result. The actual reasons Steve had, were also very important. If what he espoused hadn't made sense, it wouldn't have been effective.

*But individuals are far from the only cause of this problem. In fact, if you study the root causes of business disasters, over and over you’ll find a predisposition toward endeavors that offer immediate gratification over endeavors that result in long-term success. Many companies’ decision-making systems are designed to steer investments to initiatives that offer the most tangible and immediate returns, so companies often favor these and shortchange investments in initiatives that are crucial to their long-term strategies.*

**What's the nature of the cases where short-term investments are the better choice?

---
Page: 60

*Here is a way to frame the investments that we make in the strategy that becomes our lives: we have resources—which include personal time, energy, talent, and wealth—and we are using them to try to grow several “businesses” in our personal lives. These include having a rewarding relationship with our spouse or significant other; raising great children; succeeding in our careers; contributing to our church or community; and so on. Unfortunately, however, our resources are limited and these businesses are competing for them. It’s exactly the same problem that a corporation has. How should we devote our resources to each of these pursuits?*

**An individual does not have the same scalability as a company, it's much more of a zerosum game. 

---
Page: 63

*How do you make sure that you’re implementing the strategy you truly want to implement? Watch where your resources flow—the resource allocation process. If it is not supporting the strategy you’ve decided upon, you run the risk of a serious problem. You might think you are a charitable person, but how often do you really give your time or money to a cause or an organization that you care about? If your family matters most to you, when you think about all the choices you’ve made with your time in a week, does your family seem to come out on top? Because if the decisions you make about where you invest your blood, sweat, and tears are not consistent with the person you aspire to be, you’ll never become that person.*

**A self budget would be very interesting. Where exactly do I put my money, time and energy? In selfcare, education, job, relationships, play, exploration, etc. Out of the 720 hours in the month, how many hours go where?

Page: 67

*You have to make sure that you allocate your resources in a way that is consistent with your priorities. You have to make sure that your own measures of success are aligned with your most important concern. And you have to make sure that you’re thinking about all these in the right time frame—overcome the natural tendency to focus on the short term at the expense of the long term.
It’s rarely easy. Even when you know what your true priorities are, you’ll have to fight to uphold them in your own mind every day. For example: like many of you, I suspect, I’m naturally drawn to interesting problems and challenges. I can lose myself in one for hours; solving it will give me a short-term “high.” It would be easy for me to stay late at work noodling on one of these challenges, or to be stopped in the hallway to have an interesting conversation with a colleague, or to answer the phone and find myself agreeing to work on something completely new and be genuinely excited by the prospect.
But I know that spending my time this way is not consistent with my priorities. I’ve had to force myself to stay aligned with what matters most to me by setting hard stops, barriers, and boundaries in my life—such as leaving the office at six every day so that there is daylight time to play catch with my son, or to take my daughter to a ballet lesson—to keep myself true to what I most value.*

**Short-term decisions should be for exceptional circumstances where you need to heavily shift attention to something even if it's not your highest priority. However you need to absolutely set boundaries so that the exceptions don't become the norm.

**How do you decide what your priorities should be? How do you find out what to value? The joy it gives you? The impact on the world?

*The relationships you have with family and close friends are going to be the most important sources of happiness in your life. But you have to be careful. When it seems like everything at home is going well, you will be lulled into believing that you can put your investments in these relationships onto the back burner. That would be an enormous mistake. By the time serious problems arise in those relationships, it often is too late to repair them. This means, almost paradoxically, that the time when it is most important to invest in building strong families and close friendships is when it appears, at the surface, as if it’s not necessary.*

**A bond needs to be strengthened before it's put under pressure. 

**The author has kind of decided that family and close friends should be everyone's top priority.

*This theory explains how and why Honda ultimately succeeded in its attack against the U.S. motorcycle industry, whereas Motorola failed with Iridium. Ironically, Honda succeeded because the company was so financially constrained in its early days, it was forced to be patient for growth while it figured out its profit model. If Honda had had more resources to give to its U.S. operations, it might have been willing to throw more money into continuing to pursue the large-motorcycle strategy, even though it was unlikely to be profitable. As an investment, that would have been bad money. Instead, Honda almost had no choice but to focus on the Super Cub, because, to survive, it needed the money the little bike generated. That was a big part of the reason that Honda ended up doing so well in the United States—its investment was forced to abide by the theory.*

**There has to be a sweet spot there. No capital is too little. What is the sweet spot? Depends on the field of business perhaps?

*Each of us can point to one or two friendships we’ve unintentionally neglected when life got busy. You might be hoping that the bonds of your friendship are strong enough to endure such neglect, but that’s seldom the case. Even the most committed friends will attempt to stay the course for only so long before they choose to invest their own time, energy, and friendship somewhere else. If they do, the loss will be yours.
People in their later years in life so often lament that they didn’t keep in better touch with friends and relatives who once mattered profoundly to them. Life just seemed to get in the way. The consequences of letting that happen, however, can be enormous. I’ve known too many people like Steve, who have had to walk through a health struggle or a divorce or a job loss alone—with nobody to provide a sounding board or other means of support.
That can be the loneliest place in the world.*

**What if the friend you're trying to stay close to is like Steve? At what point do you stop investing in a relationship?

*After meticulously observing and recording all of the interactions between parent and child, they noticed that on average, parents speak 1,500 words per hour to their infant children. “Talkative” (often college-educated) parents spoke 2,100 words to their child, on average. By contrast, parents from less verbal (and often less-educated) backgrounds spoke only 600 per hour, on average. If you add that up over the first thirty months, the child of “talkative” parents heard an estimated 48 million words spoken, compared to the disadvantaged child, who heard only 13 million. The most important time for the children to hear the words, the research suggests, is the first year of life.*

**That's actually an interesting data point. And by God, children are so like neural networks that a 3x dataset has to be quite impactful.

*If you defer investing your time and energy until you see that you need to, chances are it will already be too late. But as you are getting your career off the ground, you will be tempted to do exactly that: assume you can defer investing in your personal relationships. You cannot. The only way to have those relationships bear fruit in your life is to invest long before you need them.*

**How do I invest in those relationships?

*Many products fail because companies develop them from the wrong perspective. Companies focus too much on what they want to sell their customers, rather than what those customers really need. What’s missing is empathy: a deep understanding of what problems customers are trying to solve. The same is true in our relationships: we go into them thinking about what we want rather than what is important to the other person. Changing your perspective is a powerful way to deepen your relationships.*

**It's so easy to project your own wants and needs onto others. Listening is the key.

*Through my research on innovation for the past two decades, my colleagues and I have developed a theory about this approach to marketing and product development, which we call “the job to be done.” The insight behind this way of thinking is that what causes us to buy a product or service is that we actually hire products to do jobs for us.
What do I mean by that? We don’t go through life conforming to particular demographic segments: nobody buys a product because he is an eighteen- to thirty-five-year-old white male getting a college degree. That may be correlated with a decision to buy this product instead of that one, but it doesn’t cause us to buy anything. Instead, periodically we find that some job has arisen in our lives that we need to do, and we then find some way to get it done.*

**Causation is much more satisfying to work with.

*This thoughtful combination allows shoppers to quickly get everything done at once. It would seem counterintuitive to have the stores half an hour away, but this decision actually makes it much easier for people to get everything they need in one trip. It lets IKEA build a bigger store to ensure its furniture is always in stock. It has the space to build a supervised play area to keep the kids occupied—which is important because having a child tugging at your sleeve might cause you to forget something or rush through a decision. In case you get hungry, IKEA has a restaurant in the building so you don’t have to leave. Its products are all flat-packed so that you can get them home quickly and easily in your own car. If you happen to buy so much that you can’t fit it all in your car, IKEA has same-day delivery. And so on.*

**They have a truly comprehensive grasp on the customer journey. It reminds me of Toni Fadells approach. It's like they're able to frame the problem so that they get maximum leverage on it.

*he asked him, “What caused you to develop this game?” Rather than justifying the game he developed, the inventor’s answer identified a problem that arose repeatedly in his life: “I have three young children and a demanding job. By the time I get home from work and we finish dinner, it’s eight o’clock and the kids need to go to bed. But we haven’t had any fun together. What am I going to do? Set up Monopoly or Risk? I need some fun games that we can set up, play, and put away in fifteen minutes.”
Aha! This job arose in this man’s life at least five days a week.
Though Collins felt that the father’s game was only mediocre, the valuable insight was the job itself. Millions of busy parents think about the same thing every evening. The identification of the job the inventor was trying to do led to a very successful line called “12 Minute Games.” It was only through living with a real problem that the dad had the insight to create a line of games that do a job important to millions of people.*

**What single purpose solutions can I find to problems throughout my week? Where have I had to say "I can't do that right now because of X"?

*There is no way that we can motivate children to work harder in class by convincing them that they should do this. Rather, we need to offer children experiences in school that help them do these jobs—to feel successful and do it with friends.
Schools that have designed their curriculum so that students feel success every day see rates of dropping out and absenteeism fall to nearly zero. When structured to do the job of success, students eagerly master difficult material—because in doing so, they are getting the job done.*

**I like the reach of this principle, it applies to tiny products just as well as abstract complex issues like education.

Page: 92

*If you work to understand what job you are being hired to do, both professionally and in your personal life, the payoff will be enormous. In fact, it is here that this theory yields the most insight, simply because one of the most important jobs you’ll ever be hired to do is to be a spouse. Getting this right, I believe, is critical to sustaining a happy marriage.*

**I don't think I've ever asked myself the question, why does X need me? What do they want and need from me? What do they expect? What role am I filling in their life? 

---
Page: 92

*More important, the jobs that your spouse is trying to do are often very different from the jobs that you think she should want to do.
Ironically, it is for this reason that many unhappy marriages are often built upon selflessness. But the selflessness is based on the partners giving each other things that they want to give, and which they have decided that their partner ought to want—as in, “Honey, believe me, you are going to love this Iridium wireless telephone!”*

**It's a great form of misalignment, like trying to press a triangle through a square. 

---
Page: 94

*I suspect that if we studied marriage from the job-to-be-done lens, we would find that the husbands and wives who are most loyal to each other are those who have figured out the jobs that their partner needs to be done—and then they do the job reliably and well. I know for me, this has a profound effect. By working to truly understand the job she needs done, and doing it well, I can cause myself to fall more deeply in love with my spouse, and, I hope, her with me. Divorce, on the other hand, often has its roots when one frames marriage only in terms of whether she is giving me what I want. If she isn’t, then I dispense with her, and find someone else who will.*

**What is the mechanism for discovering what she and the customer actually needs? Frame it as a job need, do some thinking, try it out and get feedback. 

---
Page: 94

*This may sound counterintuitive, but I deeply believe that the path to happiness in a relationship is not just about finding someone who you think is going to make you happy. Rather, the reverse is equally true: the path to happiness is about finding someone who you want to make happy, someone whose happiness is worth devoting yourself to. If what causes us to fall deeply in love is mutually understanding and then doing each other’s job to be done, then I have observed that what cements that commitment is the extent to which I sacrifice myself to help her succeed and for her to be happy.
This principle—that sacrifice deepens our commitment—doesn’t just work in marriages. It applies to members of our family and close friends, as well as organizations and even cultures and nations.*

**Find the X that you want to serve and want to make genuinely happy. Is there a market that I particularly care about?

---
Page: 96

*Given that sacrifice deepens our commitment, it’s important to ensure that what we sacrifice for is worthy of that commitment, as the church was for me and Annie. Perhaps nothing deserves sacrifice more than family—and not just that others should sacrifice for you, but that you should sacrifice for your family, too. I believe it is an essential foundation to deep friendships and fulfilling, happy families and marriages.*

**This is what I mean with vessels that we can pour all our efforts into. It can be something you create.

*Capabilities are dynamic and built over time; no company starts out with its capabilities fully developed. The most tangible of the three factors is resources, which include people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands, information, cash, and relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. Resources are usually people or things—they can be hired and fired, bought and sold, depreciated or built. Many resources are visible and often are measurable, so managers can readily assess their value. Most people might think that resources are what make a business successful.
But resources are only one of three critical factors driving a business. Organizations create value as employees transform resources into products and services of greater worth. The ways in which those employees interact, coordinate, communicate, and make decisions are known as processes. These enable the resources to solve more and more complicated problems.
Processes include the ways that products are developed and made, and the methods by which market research, budgeting, employee development, compensation, and resource allocation are accomplished. Unlike resources, which are often easily seen and measured, processes can’t be seen on a balance sheet.
If a company has strong processes in place, managers have flexibility about which employees they put on which assignments—because the process will work regardless of who performs it. Take, for example, consulting firm McKinsey, which is hired to help companies around the world. McKinsey’s processes are so pervasive that consultants from very different backgrounds and training can be “plugged” into the processes by which they habitually do their work—with confidence that they will deliver the needed results.
The third—and perhaps most significant—capability is an organization’s priorities. This set of factors defines how a company makes decisions; it can give clear guidance about what a company is likely to invest in, and what it will not. Employees at every level will make prioritization decisions—what they will focus on today, and what they’ll put at the bottom of their list.
Managers can’t be there to watch over every decision as a company gets bigger. That’s why the larger and more complex a company becomes, the more important it is for senior managers to ensure employees make, by themselves, prioritization decisions that are consistent with the strategic direction and the business model of the company. It means that successful senior executives need to spend a lot of time articulating clear, consistent priorities that are broadly understood throughout the organization. Over time, a company’s priorities must be in sync with how the company makes money, because employees must prioritize those things that support the company’s strategy, if the company is to survive. Otherwise the decisions they make will be in conflict with the foundation of the business.*

**I love this summary of assessing the capabilities of a company. Resources, process and priorities.

*The tables truly have turned. At the beginning, American companies outsourced simple things to drive costs down and get assets off their balance sheets. As is often the case, each of the decisions by themselves seemed to make sense. Now, however, they must outsource sophisticated products because they can no longer make them.
The theory of capabilities gives companies the framework to determine when outsourcing makes sense, and when it does not. There are two important considerations. First, you must take a dynamic view of your suppliers’ capabilities. Assume that they can and will change. You should not focus on what the suppliers are doing now, but, rather, focus on what they are striving to be able to do in the future. Second, and most critical of all: figure out what capabilities you will need to succeed in the future. These must stay in-house—otherwise, you are handing over the future of your business. Understanding the power and importance of capabilities can make the difference between a good CEO and a mediocre one.*

**Understanding the importance of protecting your business critical capabilities also opens up your eyes to the predatory strategies employed by some companies. It makes sense to move up the market, slowly eating your way to becoming a competitive force. Doing it this way does however come with the disadvantage of not being able to create a missionary driven culture. Who'd feel that they're doing the right thing if the strategy is to plagiarize?

*To understand how all three work together, let’s continue the example of a child developing an iPad app. If your child has a computer on which to program, and knowledge of how to program an iPad app, he has resources. The way in which he pulls these resources together to create something novel, something that he hasn’t been taught explicitly how to do, to learn as he goes along—these are his processes. And the desire he has to spend his precious free time creating the app, the problem he cares about enough to create the app to solve, the idea of creating something unique, or the fact that he cares that his friends will be impressed—those are the priorities leading him to do it. Resources are what he uses to do it, processes are how he does it, and priorities are why he does it.*

**Mapping resources, processes and priorities onto what, how and why is illuminating. How can I make progress in all of these myself? How do you teach it to a child? What is the optimal version?

---
Page: 108

*When these other intentions start creeping in, and parents seem to be carting their children around to an endless array of activities in which the kids are not truly engaged, it should start to raise red flags. Are the children developing from these experiences the deep, important processes such as teamwork, entrepreneurship, and learning the value of preparation? Or are they just going along for the ride? When we so heavily focus on providing our children with resources, we need to ask ourselves a new set of questions: Has my child developed the skill to develop better skills? The knowledge to develop deeper knowledge? The experience to learn from his experiences? These are the critical differences between resources and processes in our children’s minds and hearts—and, I fear, the unanticipated residual of outsourcing.*

**The sooner you learn how to learn the more time your knowledge will have had to accrue, and knowledge compounds so the sooner you start the sooner your exponential curve takes off.

*children will learn when they are ready to learn, not when we’re ready to teach them.”
It’s a beautiful way of articulating the importance of building the third of the capabilities—priorities. It affects what our children will put first in their lives. In fact, it may be the single most important capability we can give our kids.
You can probably recall similar moments from your own childhood—the times that you picked up something important from your parents that they probably weren’t aware they were sharing. Your parents most likely weren’t thinking consciously about teaching you the right priorities at the time—but simply because they were there with you in those learning moments, those values became your values, too. Which means that first, when children are ready to learn, we need to be there. And second, we need to be found displaying through our actions, the priorities and values that we want our children to learn.*

**A lot of my values are completely invisible to me. I'd like to get a better grasp on them and shape them into something that my imaginary children would respect and become successful from emulating. I would like to serve the cosmos somehow too.

*The “right stuff” thinking lists skills that are correlated with success. It is, using the description of theory discussed earlier, looking to see whether job candidates have wings and feathers. McCall’s schools of experience model asks whether they have actually flown, and if so, in what circumstances. This model helps identify whether, in an earlier assignment, someone has actually wrestled with a problem similar to the one he will need to wrestle with now. In terms of the language of the capabilities from earlier, it is a search for process capabilities.
Unlike the “right stuff” model, McCall’s thinking is not based on the idea that great leaders are born ready to go. Rather, their abilities are developed and shaped by experiences in life. A challenging job, a failure in leading a project, an assignment in a new area of the company—all those things become “courses” in the school of experience. The skills that leaders have—or lack—depend heavily on which “courses,” so to speak, they have and have not taken along the way.*

**Finding proxies for suitability to the work the employee will do is going to be flawed at best. Dig deep to understand the processes by which the person operates and think about whether that aligns with your needs. Experience is more important than innate talent for tasks that are rather unnatural.

*When we compared the candidates’ résumés, Candidate A won hands-down. He had the “right stuff”—the adjectives about him just blew Candidate B out of the water. But that didn’t make him right for us. Had we looked for the past-tense verbs on their résumés, however, Candidate B would have won hands-down—because the résumé would have shown that he had taken the right courses in the schools of experience—including a field graduate seminar called “Scaling up process technology from the lab, through pilot scale, and then full scale.” He had wrestled with problems that the rest of us did not even know we were going to face.
Or, in other words, he had the right processes to do the job. In expressing a preference for the more polished candidate, we biased ourselves toward resources over the processes.*

**The how is very valuable, the why is teachable.

*Archibald had a clear goal in mind when he graduated from college—he wanted to become CEO of a successful company. But instead of setting out on what most people thought would be the “right,” prestigious stepping-stone jobs to get there, he asked himself: “What are all the experiences and problems that I have to learn about and master so that what comes out at the other end is somebody who is ready and capable of becoming a successful CEO?”
That meant Archibald was prepared to make some unconventional moves in the early years of his career—moves his peers at business school might not have understood on the surface. Instead of taking jobs or assignments because they looked like a fast-track to the C-suite, he chose his options very deliberately for the experience they would provide.*

**With a great compass you can embark on a non-objective search journey. You won't become great at what you do when you're chasing promotions.

*In some ways, the awards are really for the parents—it is often we who get the most out of seeing the accumulation of medals and ribbons. It sure feels better to congratulate our kids on their achievements than it does to console them for a tough failure. In fact, it’s very tempting for many parents to step in to ensure that their child is always succeeding. But what are they getting from that?
When I worked with Boy Scouts over the years, I always wanted the kids to take responsibility for organizing their own camping trips rather than letting the parents step in to do it. When they had to do it themselves, they learned how to plan and organize, how to divide responsibilities, how to communicate among a group, and to appreciate what they’d actually put their own work into.*

**I would like a checklist with general life skills that you will definitely need if you want to be a competent person.

*Creating experiences for your children doesn’t guarantee that they’ll learn what they need to learn. If that doesn’t happen, you have to figure out why that experience didn’t achieve it. You might have to iterate through different ideas until you get it right. The important thing for a parent is, as always, to never give up; never stop trying to help your children get the right experiences to prepare them for life.
Like in the example with our hiring managers at the start of this chapter, it’s tempting to judge success by a résumé—by looking at the scoreboard of what our children have achieved. But much more important in the long run is what courses our kids have taken as they’ve gone through the various schools of experience. More than any award or trophy, this is the best way to equip them for success as they venture out into the world.*

**I wonder how easy it is to engineer experiences for yourself. A mentor could be very useful.

*The best tool we have to help our children do this is through the culture we build in our families.
Enterprises and families are very similar in this respect. Just like your parents wanted you to make good decisions, business leaders want to ensure that midlevel managers and employees everywhere in the company make the right choices every day without requiring constant supervision. This is nothing new: as far back as ancient Rome, emperors would send an associate off to govern a newly conquered territory thousands of miles away. As the emperors watched the chariot go over the hill—knowing full well they would not see their associate again for years—they needed to know that their understudy’s priorities were consistent with their own, and that he would use proven, accepted methods to solve problems. Culture was the only way to make sure this happened.*

**How do you maintain culture at a distance? If it's bored down into the core of their being then it's not culture, it's more like values. Culture may be the way that values are transmitted.

*Every time they tackle a problem, employees aren’t just solving the problem itself; in solving it, they are learning what matters. In the language of capabilities from the previous chapters, they are creating an understanding of the priorities in the business, and how to execute them—the processes. A culture is the unique combination of processes and priorities within an organization.
As long as the way they have chosen keeps working to solve the problem—it doesn’t have to be perfect, but working well enough—the culture will coalesce and become an internal set of rules and guidelines that employees in the company will draw upon in making the choices ahead of them.*

**Will it settle at a local optimum? What determines that? Will a high bar make sure that doesn't happen? Is it the problem itself that sets the bar?

---

*You can tell the health of a company’s culture by asking, “When faced with a choice on how to do something, did employees make the decision that the culture ‘wanted’ them to make? And was the feedback they received consistent with that?” If these elements aren’t actively managed, then a single wrong decision or wrong outcome can quite easily send a firm’s culture down entirely the wrong path.*

**How many cycles does there have to be for the culture to take root? The cycles involve framing the problem, solving it, getting feedback on it. It's in the framing and the feedback that the manager has levers to steer the culture.

*My wife, Christine, and I started, when we were newly engaged, with an end goal—a specific family culture—in mind. We didn’t think about it in terms of culture, but that’s what we were doing. We decided in a deliberate fashion that we wanted our children to love each other and to support each other. We decided we wanted our children to have an instinct to obey God. We decided we wanted them to be kind. And, finally, we decided that we wanted them to love work.*

**What culture would I want for my family? Humor is in there. Being open and accepting is there. Courage is in there. Humbleness is there. Creativity, novelty, thinking deep thoughts.

*But in the pressures of day-to-day living, that can be tough. There will be many days when enforcing the rules is harder on a parent than it is on a child. With good intentions, many exhausted parents find it too difficult to stay consistent with their rules early on—and inadvertently, they allow a culture of laziness or defiance to creep into their family.
Children might feel “success” in the short term by getting what they want in beating up a sibling, or talking back to a parent who finally relents to an unreasonable demand. Parents who let such behavior slide are essentially building a family culture—teaching their child that this is the way the world works, and that they can achieve their goals the same way each time.*

**You need to be extremely diligent or you need the culture you aspire to be so deeply part of your default way of operating.

*It is for this reason that as I look back at my life, I’m actually very glad we didn’t have enough money to buy a perfectly finished house when our children were young. We stretched so far to buy that first wreck of a house that we later couldn’t afford to pay tradesmen to fix it up for us. Everything that needed to be fixed had to be fixed by us and by the kids. Now, most people would think of this as a complete chore.
But inadvertently, we had moved our family into an environment rich in opportunities for us to work together.*

**Putting yourself into circumstances that affords many challenges is the best way to challenge yourself, because if you're forced to do it then you will.

*Most of us think that the important ethical decisions in our lives will be delivered with a blinking red neon sign: CAUTION: IMPORTANT DECISION AHEAD. Never mind how busy we are or what the consequences might be. Almost everyone is confident that in those moments of truth, he or she will do the right thing. After all, how many people do you know who believe they do not have integrity?
The problem is, life seldom works that way. It comes with no warning signs. Instead, most of us will face a series of small, everyday decisions that rarely seem like they have high stakes attached. But over time, they can play out far more dramatically.
It happens exactly the same way in companies. No company deliberately sets out to let itself be overtaken by its competitors. Rather, they are seemingly innocuous decisions that were made years before that led them down that path. This chapter will explain how that process happens so you can avoid falling into the most beguiling trap of all.*

**The slow trickle of death by a thousand cuts has been the trickiest trap to deal with in my startup. You essentially have many small problems that individually are invisible on the radar but at the end they pile up so that you crumble under their combined weight.

*The answer is in the theory of marginal versus full costs. Every time an executive in an established company needs to make an investment decision, there are two alternatives on the menu. The first is the full cost of making something completely new. The second is to leverage what already exists, so that you only need to incur the marginal cost and revenue. Almost always, the marginal-cost argument overwhelms the full-cost. For the entrant, in contrast, there is no marginal-cost item on the menu. If it makes sense, then you do the full-cost alternative. Because they are new to the scene, in fact, the full cost is the marginal cost.
When there is competition, and this theory causes established companies to continue to use what they already have in place, they pay far more than the full cost—because the company loses its competitiveness.
As Henry Ford once put it, “If you need a machine and don’t buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don’t have it.”*

**Think of it as if you'd have no other option, what's the potential of the new capability you'd create? What's the logical conclusion of not having it?

*The marginal cost of doing something “just this once” always seems to be negligible, but the full cost will typically be much higher. Yet unconsciously, we will naturally employ the marginal-cost doctrine in our personal lives. A voice in our head says, “Look, I know that as a general rule, most people shouldn’t do this. But in this particular extenuating circumstance, just this once, it’s okay.” And the voice in our head seems to be right; the price of doing something wrong “just this once” usually appears alluringly low. It suckers you in, and you don’t see where that path is ultimately headed or the full cost that the choice entails.*

**You don't know which stepping stones will take you to ruin. Jumping on a couple of bad but seemingly small ones is always the wrong way. What are you saving apart from effort?

*Nick Leeson, the twenty-six-year-old trader who famously brought down British merchant bank Barings in 1995 after racking up $1.3 billion in trading losses before being detected, suffered exactly this fate and talks eloquently about how marginal thinking led him down an inconceivable path. In hindsight, it all started with one small step: a relatively small error. But he didn’t want to admit to it. Instead, he covered it up by hiding the loss in a little-scrutinized trading account.
It led him deeper and deeper down a path of deception. He made a series of bets in order to pay the losses back—but rather than paying off, they made the problem worse. He lied to cover lies; he forged documents, misled auditors, and made false statements to try to hide his mounting losses.*

**One bad stepping stone opens up the path to worse and worse stepping stones. The opposite is true as well.

---
Page: 151

*The costs of taking the high road are always clear like that. But the costs of taking the low road—the one Leeson took—don’t seem that bad at the start.*

**I guess that's another reason why it feels like the better choice at the time, you're not taking into account the full cost of it.

*If you give in to “just this once,” based on a marginal-cost analysis, you’ll regret where you end up. That’s the lesson I learned: it’s easier to hold to your principles 100 percent of the time than it is to hold to them 98 percent of the time. The boundary—your personal moral line—is powerful, because you don’t cross it; if you have justified doing it once, there’s nothing to stop you doing it again.
Decide what you stand for. And then stand for it all the time.*

**By crossing your own boundary once the power that it has is removed.

*When a company is faced with making an investment in future innovation, it usually crunches the numbers to decide what to do from the perspective of its existing operations. Based on how those numbers play out, it may decide to forgo the investment if the marginal upside is not worth the marginal cost of undertaking the investment. But there’s a big mistake buried in that thinking.
And that’s the trap of marginal thinking. You can see the immediate costs of investing, but it’s really hard to accurately see the costs of not investing. When you decide that the upside of investing in the new product isn’t substantial enough while you still have a perfectly acceptable existing product, you aren’t taking into account a future in which somebody else brings the new product to market. You’re assuming everything else—specifically, the money you make on the old product—will continue forever exactly as it has up until now. A company may not see any consequences of that decision for some time. It might not get “caught” in the short term if a competitor doesn’t get ahead. But the company that makes all its decisions through this marginal-costs lens will, eventually, pay the price. So often this is what causes successful companies to keep from investing in their future and, ultimately, to fail.*

**I'd like to use this critique on Donald Reinertsens ideas. I think his work contains some marginal thinking traps.

*These three parts—likeness, commitment, and metrics—comprise a company’s purpose. Companies that aspire to positive impact must never leave their purpose to chance. Worthy purposes rarely emerge inadvertently; the world is too full of mirage, paradox, and uncertainty to leave this to fate. Purpose must be deliberately conceived and chosen, and then pursued. When that is in place, however, then how the company gets there is typically emergent—as opportunities and challenges emerge and are pursued. The greatest corporate leaders are conscious of the power of purpose in helping their companies make their mark on the world.*

**How does one formulate ones own purpose? It's not an event, it's a process. The why is not a description, it's a process and it feeds into the process of how. The why should be more stable than the how, but how should one think about iterating on it?

*From these parts of my life, I distilled the likeness of what I wanted to become:
A man who is dedicated to helping improve the lives of other people
A kind, honest, forgiving, and selfless husband, father, and friend
A man who just doesn’t just believe in God, but who believes God
I recognize that many of us might come to similar conclusions, whether based on religious beliefs or not, about the likeness we aspire to. It’s a form of setting goals for yourself—the most important ones you’ll ever set. But the likeness you draw will only have value to you if you create it for yourself.*

**A three part purpose seems solid. What do I value in others? Who do I admire and why? What is my world view and my view on my own place in the world? I don't have a lot to go on in terms of my upbringing but there could be powerful counterexamples there and it's also quite powerful to start from scratch. 

---
Page: 160

*Each of us may have a different process for committing to our likeness. But what is universal is that your intent must be to answer this question: who do I truly want to become?
If you begin to feel that the likeness you have sketched out for yourself is not right—that this is not the person you want to become—then you must revisit your likeness. But if it becomes clear that it is the person you want to become, then you must devote your life to becoming that person.*

**You can get attached to a likeness that you think you want to become but deep inside you don't truly want. Honesty is key. You might truly want to become something but still struggle. Discipline is key.

*I apply the tools of econometrics a few times a year, but I apply my knowledge of the purpose of my life every day. This is the most valuable, useful piece of knowledge that I have ever gained.*

**I'll remind myself of this when I get confused about priorities.

Page: 162

*Because of this implicit need for aggregation, we develop a sense of hierarchy: people who preside over more people are more important than people who are leaders of fewer people. A CEO is more important than a general manager of a business unit; that general manager is more important than the director of sales; and so on.
Now let me explain in religious terms: I realized that God, in contrast to us, does not need the tools of statisticians or accountants. So far as I know, He has no organization charts. There is no need to aggregate anything beyond the level of an individual person in order to comprehend completely what is going on among humankind. His only measure of achievement is the individual.
Somehow, after all of this, I came to understand that while many of us might default to measuring our lives by summary statistics, such as number of people presided over, number of awards, or dollars accumulated in a bank, and so on, the only metrics that will truly matter to my life are the individuals whom I have been able to help, one by one, to become better people. When I have my interview with God, our conversation will focus on the individuals whose self-esteem I was able to strengthen, whose faith I was able to reinforce, and whose discomfort I was able to assuage—a doer of good, regardless of what assignment I had. These are the metrics that matter in measuring my life.*

**This is a nice antidote to the obsession with scale and impact. Accumulating numbers says nothing about the way you've personally shared participatory knowing with other humans. To laugh, to create, to feel with others brings joy.
