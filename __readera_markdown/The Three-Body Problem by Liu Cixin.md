*Ba??les like ?his one raged across Bei?ing like a mul?i?ude o? CPUs working in parallel, ?heir combined ou?pu?, ?he Cul?ural Revolu?ion.*

**Cool to see a computer metaphor so early. A nice description of emergence.

*As ?he revolu?ionaries had splin?ered in?o numerous ?ac?ions, opposing ?orces everywhere engaged in complex maneuvers and con?es?s.*

**This seems similar to what happened in Homage to Catalonia. Is it something that always happen when there's a revolution going on? Why does it happen? Is it because there's a sudden surge of energy trying to grab the power that was unleashed by breaking the bond the rulers had over their subjects?

*After your father recounted this memory to me, he sighed and said, “In China, any idea that dared to take flight would only crash back to the ground. The gra?ity of reality is too strong.”*

**An apathy towards creativity induced by a lack of freedom and personal sovereignty.

*Bu? as she was abou? ?o leave Ruan’s home, Wen?ie ?urned around ?or a ?inal look. She no?iced ?ha? Pro?essor Ruan had pu? on makeup. She was wearing a ligh? coa? o? lips?ick and a pair o? high heels.*

**A final gesture of rebellion against madness.

*The book deal? only wi?h a limi?ed sub?ec?: ?he nega?ive environmen?al e??ec?s o? excessive pes?icide use. Bu? ?he perspec?ive ?aken by ?he au?hor shook Ye ?o ?he core. The use o? pes?icides had seemed ?o Ye ?us? a normal, proper—or, a? leas?, neu?ral—ac?, bu? Carson’s book allowed Ye ?o see ?ha?, ?rom Na?ure’s perspec?ive, ?heir use was indis?inguishable ?rom ?he Cul?ural Revolu?ion, and equally des?ruc?ive ?o our world. I? ?his was so, ?hen how many o?her ac?s o? humankind ?ha? had seemed normal or even righ?eous were, in reali?y, evil?*

**Will the extermination of the human species feel just as natural to aliens?

*It was impossible to expect a moral awakening from humankind itself, ?ust like it was impossible to expect humans to lift off the earth by pulling up on their own hair. To achie?e moral awakening required a force outside the human race.*

**The system cannot transcend itself.

*When I ?alked wi?h ?hem, all ?he ?opics were … how do I pu? ?his? Very radical.
They all involved ?he ques?ion ?ha? Dr. Ding ?us? described: Wha? is ?he limi? o? science?*

**I get a cowboy scientist vibe from the way that science and scientists are portrayed. Bold and ambitious people, not at all curbed.

*Every ?ime he wen? ou? ?o ?ake pic?ures, he would ride his bike and wander around ?he ci?y in search o? inspira?ion and composi?ions ?ha? caugh? his ?ancy.

*When ?he members o? ?he Fron?iers o? Science discussed physics, ?hey o??en used ?he abbrevia?ion “SF.” They didn’? mean “science ?ic?ion,” bu?
?he ?wo words “shoo?er” and “?armer.” This was a re?erence ?o ?wo hypo?heses, bo?h involving ?he ?undamen?al na?ure o? ?he laws o? ?he universe.
In ?he shoo?er hypo?hesis, a good marksman shoo?s a? a ?arge?, crea?ing a hole every ?en cen?ime?ers. Now suppose ?he sur?ace o? ?he ?arge? is inhabi?ed by in?elligen?, ?wo-dimensional crea?ures. Their scien?is?s, a??er observing ?he universe, discover a grea? law: “There exis?s a hole in ?he universe every ?en cen?ime?ers.” They have mis?aken ?he resul? o? ?he marksman’s momen?ary whim ?or an unal?erable law o? ?he universe.
The ?armer hypo?hesis, on ?he o?her hand, has ?he ?lavor o? a horror s?ory: Every morning on a ?urkey ?arm, ?he ?armer comes ?o ?eed ?he ?urkeys. A scien?is? ?urkey, having observed ?his pa??ern ?o hold wi?hou?
change ?or almos? a year, makes ?he ?ollowing discovery: “Every morning a? eleven, ?ood arrives.” On ?he morning o? Thanksgiving, ?he scien?is?
announces ?his law ?o ?he o?her ?urkeys. Bu? ?ha? morning a? eleven, ?ood doesn’? arrive; ins?ead, ?he ?armer comes and kills ?he en?ire ?lock.
Wang ?el? ?he road benea?h his ?ee? shi?? like quicksand. The A-shaped building seemed ?o wobble and sway. He quickly brough? his ga?e back ?o ?he s?ree?.*

**The feeling you get when everything you know turns out to be false. When all your tools for determining truth are shown to be impotent. Deduction, useless. Induction, useless.

*He s?u??ed ?he mess o? ?ilm in?o a bag, and, ?aking ?he digi?al camera, rushed ou? o? ?he apar?men? as his wi?e wa?ched him anxiously. He could have driven, bu? even wi?h ?he ci?y being ?ull o? ligh?s, he wan?ed ?o be wi?h people. He called ?or a cab.*

**When something unbelievable happens all your previous patterns are ignored. You start from zero and you are forced to find your footing somehow.

*Based on ?hese ?wo successes, Pan’s opinions on social issues had grown more and more in?luen?ial. He believed ?ha? ?echnological progress was a disease in human socie?y. The explosive developmen? o? ?echnology was analogous ?o ?he grow?h o? cancer cells, and ?he resul?s would be iden?ical: ?he exhaus?ion o? all sources o? nourishmen?, ?he des?ruc?ion o?
organs, and ?he ?inal dea?h o? ?he hos? body. He advoca?ed abolishing crude ?echnologies such as ?ossil ?uels and nuclear energy and keeping gen?ler ?echnologies such as solar power and small-scale hydroelec?ric power. He believed in ?he gradual de-urbani?a?ion o? modern me?ropolises by dis?ribu?ing ?he popula?ion more evenly in sel?-su??icien? small ?owns and villages. Relying on ?he gen?ler ?echnologies, he would build a new agricul?ural socie?y.*

**The exact opposite of what Matt Ridley would claim is the road to a flourishing world. De-urbanizing would kill the greatest innovation machine on earth, the City.

*“I? is morning. Bu? ?he sun doesn’? always rise in ?he morning. Tha?’s wha? a Chao?ic Era is like.”*

**This is the most common inductive reasoning example, "the sun has risen every morning for my entire life, so I expect it to rise every morning for the rest of my life". It's another version of the farmer and the turkey story. The scale of human life is too small to be able to inductivelly tell anything from experience about anything. What tools can we use to find our bearings in a chaotic era?

*“How long does a S?able Era las??” Wang asked.
“As shor? as a day or as long as a cen?ury. No one can predic? how long one will las?.” King Wen sa? on ?he sandglass, li??ing his head ?o ga?e a? ?he noonday sun. “According ?o his?orical records, ?he Wes?ern Zhou Dynas?y experienced a S?able Era las?ing ?wo cen?uries. How lucky ?o be born during such a ?ime!”
“Then how long does a Chao?ic Era las??”
“I already ?old you. O?her ?han S?able Eras, all o?her ?imes belong ?o Chao?ic Eras. Each o? ?hem ?akes up ?he ?ime no? occupied by ?he o?her.”
“So, ?his is a world in which ?here are no pa??erns?”
“Yes. Civili?a?ion can only develop in ?he mild clima?e o? S?able Eras.
Mos? o? ?he ?ime, humankind mus? collec?ively dehydra?e and be s?ored.
When a long S?able Era arrives, ?hey collec?ively revive ?hrough rehydra?ion. Then ?hey proceed ?o build and produce.”
“How can you predic? ?he arrival and dura?ion o? each S?able Era?”
“Such a ?hing has never been done. When a S?able Era arrives, ?he king makes a decision based on in?ui?ion as ?o whe?her ?o engage in mass rehydra?ion. O??en, ?he people are revived, crops are plan?ed, ci?ies begin cons?ruc?ion, li?e has ?us? s?ar?ed—and ?hen ?he S?able Era ends. Ex?reme cold and hea? ?hen des?roy every?hing.” King Wen now poin?ed a? Wang, his eyes sparkling. “Now you know ?he goal o? ?his game: ?o use our in?ellec?
and unders?anding ?o analy?e all phenomena un?il we can know ?he pa??ern o? ?he sun’s movemen?. The survival o? civili?a?ion depends on i?.”
“Based on my observa?ions, ?here is no pa??ern ?o ?he sun’s movemen? a?
all.”
“Tha?’s because you do no? unders?and ?he ?undamen?al na?ure o? ?he world.”
“And you do?”
“Yes. This is why I’m going ?o Zhao Ge. I will presen? King Zhou wi?h an accura?e calendar.”
“Bu? I’ve seen no evidence on ?his ?rip ?ha? you can do such a ?hing.”
“Predic?ing ?he sun’s mo?ion is only possible in Zhao Ge, ?or ?ha? is where yin and yang mee?. Only ?he lo?s cas? ?here are accura?e.”*

**Order is fleeting. This applies at several levels, all the way from the cosmos, down through civilization, personal relationships, all the way down to the origin of life itself.

Page: 91

*As ?hey walked, King Wen spoke ?o Wang. “During a Chao?ic Era, ?he en?ire coun?ry is dehydra?ed. Bu? King Zhou remains awake, a companion ?o ?he li?eless land. In order ?o survive during a Chao?ic Era, one mus? live in ?hick-walled buildings like ?his one, as ?hough one were living underground. I?’s ?he only way ?o avoid ?he ex?reme hea? and cold.”*

**Is this speculation on our caveman and pyramid days?

*“Rehydra?e!” one man cried ou?.
“Rehydra?e! Rehydra?e!” O?her voices ?oyously echoed his.
Everyone climbed ou? o? ?he lake and ran naked ?oward ?he dehydra?ory.
They carried ou? more skins and ?ossed ?hem in?o ?he wa?er, and even more o? ?he revived climbed ou? o? ?he lake. The same scene repea?ed i?sel?
around every lake and pool. The en?ire world was coming back ?o li?e.*

**Feels a little bit like exponential process of mitosis.

*A??er ano?her ?en days, ?he snow?lakes ?urned ?hin and ?ranslucen?. By ?he weak ligh? ?rom a ?ew ?orches wi?hin ?he en?rance ?o ?he long ?unnel, ?he snow?lakes gave o?? a ?ain? blue glow, like pieces o? dancing mica.
“Those snow?lakes are now composed o? solidi?ied oxygen and ni?rogen. The a?mosphere is disappearing ?hrough deposi?ion, which means i?’s near absolu?e ?ero above.”
Snow gradually buried ?he pyramid. The lowes? layers were composed o? wa?er snow, ?hen dry ice, and ?inally, on ?op, snow made o? oxygen and ni?rogen. The nigh? sky became especially clear, and ?he s?ars glowed like a ?ield o? silver bon?ires.*

*“These days, ?hey use so much pes?icide ?ha? when I ?eed ?he children, I have ?o soak ?he vege?ables ?or a? leas? ?wo hours— Why don’? you ?ake a look in Dong Dong’s room ?irs??”*

*Wang accep?ed ?he box, warm?h ?illing his ches?. His eyes mois?ened. I?
was as ?hough his hear?, s?ressed almos? beyond ?he breaking poin? by ?he las? ?ew days, had been placed on?o a pile o? so?? down ?ea?hers. “Pro?essor Ye, I will come visi? you o??en.”*

*When he li??ed his head ?o see where his subconscious had brough? him, he shivered.
He sa? in ?ron? o? S?. Joseph’s Church a? Wang?u?ing. In ?he pale whi?e ligh? o? dawn, ?he church’s Romanesque vaul?s appeared as ?hree gian?
?ingers poin?ing ou? some?hing in space ?or him.*

**Was he looking for someone to give him answers to what cannot be known? Religion seeks to comfort us in uncertainty.

*“To be hones?, even i? I were ?o look a? ?he s?ars in ?he sky, I wouldn’?
be ?hinking abou? your philosophical ques?ions. I have ?oo much ?o worry abou?! I go??a pay ?he mor?gage, save ?or ?he kid’s college, and handle ?he endless s?ream o? cases.… I’m a simple man wi?hou? a lo? o? complica?ed ?wis?s and ?urns. Look down my ?hroa? and you can see ou? my ass.*

**This is akin to the "let's fix what we have on earth first" mentality.

*“Bu?, I did indeed inven? an ul?ima?e rule.”
“Tell me.”
“Any?hing su??icien?ly weird mus? be ?ishy.”*

*He once again ?el? ?he warm?h ?ha? he had missed. In his curren? s?a?e, his men?al s?abili?y depended on ?wo pillars:
?his old woman, who had wea?hered so many s?orms and become as gen?le as wa?er, and Shi Qiang, ?he man who ?eared no?hing because he knew no?hing.*

**Wisdom and ignorance, yin and yang.

*Lei s?ood up and s?rode away in ?he con?iden? manner o? a soldier. Ye’s eyes were ?illed wi?h ?ears. Seen ?hrough ?hem, ?he code on ?he screen became ?lickering ?lames. This was ?he ?irs? ?ime she had cried since ?he dea?h o? her ?a?her.*

**When you have nothing, even the faintest scrap of love can fill you up.

*O?hers have already sen? ?heir messages ou? in?o space. I?’s dangerous i?
ex?ra?erres?rials only hear ?heir voices. We should speak up as well. Only ?hen will ?hey ge? a comple?e pic?ure o? human socie?y.
I?’s no? possible ?o ge? ?he ?ru?h by only lis?ening ?o one side. We mus? make ?his happen, and quickly.*

**Is the competition only fear-based? Is it not for pursuing it as an end in itself?

*Bu? our world is s?ill ?lawed. Ha?e exis?s, as does pre?udice and war. Because o? con?lic?s be?ween ?he ?orces o? produc?ion and ?he rela?ions o? produc?ion, weal?h dis?ribu?ion is ex?remely uneven, and large por?ions o? humani?y live in pover?y and misery.*

**When trying to look at ourselves from an outside perspective we are more honest. The only shared outside perspective that we can have is that from outside our world.

*Ye spoke in a drawn-ou? voice, as ?hough ?elling s?ories ?o a child. “In ?he dead o? ?he nigh?, I could hear in my headphones ?he li?eless noise o? ?he universe. The noise was ?ain? bu? cons?an?, more e?ernal ?han ?he s?ars. Some?imes I ?hough? i? sounded like ?he endless win?er winds o? ?he Grea?er Khingan Moun?ains. I ?el? so cold ?hen, and ?he loneliness was indescribable.
“From ?ime ?o ?ime, I would ga?e up a? ?he s?ars a??er a nigh? shi?? and ?hink ?ha? ?hey looked like a glowing deser?, and I mysel? was a poor child abandoned in ?he deser?.… I ?hough? ?ha? li?e was ?ruly an acciden? among acciden?s in ?he universe. The universe was an emp?y palace, and humankind ?he only an? in ?he en?ire palace.*

**The flipside of the vastness. Why do we think that it's sad if there's no life? Can the movement of celestial bodies be considered protolife? Is the movement of particles enough? Why does it need to be life?

*Once ?he ?hree suns had comple?ely se?, ?he ?hick clouds ?ha? had ?ormed ?rom all ?he evapora?ed wa?er s?ill re?lec?ed ?heir glow. The sky burned, displaying a hellish, maddening beau?y.*

*Inpu? 1 and Inpu? 2 raised ?heir ?lags ?hree ?imes. The ?irs? ?ime ?hey were black-black, ?he second ?ime whi?e-black, and ?he ?hird ?ime black-whi?e. Ou?pu? reac?ed correc?ly each ?ime, raising ?he black ?lag once and ?he whi?e one ?wice.
“Very good. Your Imperial Ma?es?y, your soldiers are very smar?.”
“Even an idio? would be capable o? ?ha?. Tell me, wha? are ?hey really doing?” Qin Shi Huang looked ba??led.
“The ?hree soldiers ?orm a compu?ing componen?. I?’s a ?ype o? ga?e, an AND ga?e.” Von Neumann paused ?o le? ?he emperor diges? ?his in?orma?ion.*

**It's quite incredible that you only need a few logic gates to define all possible computations.

---
Page: 184

*Then, Von Neumann used ?he ?hree soldiers ?o ?orm a NAND ga?e, a NOR ga?e, an XOR-ga?e, an XNOR-ga?e, and a ?ris?a?e ga?e.*

**How complex can you make the gates and what impact does that have?

---
Page: 184

*Von Neumann bowed ?o ?he emperor. “Now, Your Imperial Ma?es?y, all ?he ga?e componen?s have been demons?ra?ed. Aren’? ?hey simple? Any ?hree soldiers can mas?er ?he skills a??er one hour o? ?raining.”
“Don’? ?hey need ?o learn more?” Qin Shi Huang asked.
“No. We can ?orm ?en million o? ?hese ga?es, and ?hen pu? ?he componen?s ?oge?her in?o a sys?em. This sys?em will ?hen be able ?o carry ou? ?he calcula?ions we need and work ou? ?hose di??eren?ial equa?ions ?or predic?ing ?he suns’ movemen?s.*

**Computation is substrate independent.

*“Your Imperial Ma?es?y, ?his is ?he Qin 1.0 opera?ing sys?em we developed. The so??ware ?or doing ?he calcula?ions will run on ?op o? i?.
Tha? below”—Von Neumann poin?ed ?o ?he human-?orma?ion compu?er —“is ?he hardware. Wha?’s on ?his paper is ?he so??ware. The rela?ionship be?ween hardware and so??ware is like ?ha? be?ween ?he guqin ?i?her and shee? music.”*

**I love this analogy. A computer is an instrument that can play notes in information space.

*In a momen?, ?he mo?herboard made o? ?hir?y million men seemed ?o ?urn in?o a lake ?illed wi?h sparkling ligh?s.
Tens o? millions o? ?iny ?lags waved. In ?he display ?orma?ion closes? ?o ?he base o? ?he pyramid, a progress bar made o? numerous green ?lags slowly advanced, indica?ing ?he percen?age o? ?he sel?-?es? ?ha? had been comple?ed. Ten minu?es la?er, ?he progress bar reached i?s end.
“Sel?-?es? comple?e! Begin boo? sequence! Load opera?ing sys?em!”*

**Very simple individual components can come together to create infinitely complex systems.

Page: 189

*“This is really in?eres?ing,” Qin Shi Huang said, poin?ing ?o ?he spec?acular sigh?. “Each individual’s behavior is so simple, ye? ?oge?her, ?hey can produce such a complex, grea? whole! Europeans cri?ici?e me ?or my ?yrannical rule, claiming ?ha? I suppress crea?ivi?y. Bu? in reali?y, a large number o? men yoked by severe discipline can also produce grea? wisdom when bound ?oge?her as one.”
“Grea? Firs? Emperor, ?his is ?us? ?he mechanical opera?ion o? a machine, no? wisdom. Each o? ?hese lowly individuals is ?us? a ?ero. Only when someone like you is added ?o ?he ?ron? as a one can ?he whole have any meaning.” New?on’s smile was ingra?ia?ing.
“Disgus?ing philosophy!” Von Neumann said as he glanced a? New?on.
“I?, in ?he end, ?he resul?s compu?ed in accordance wi?h your ?heory and ma?hema?ical model don’? ma?ch reali?y, ?hen you and I aren’? even ?eroes.”
“Indeed. I? ?ha? ?urns ou? ?o be ?he case, you will be no?hing!” Qin Shi Huang ?urned and le?? ?he scene.*

**Is this part of the philosophy that drives China towards totalitarianism?

*Bu? Wang did no? hear ?he noise made by colliding s?ones. Around him i? was comple?ely silen?. Because ?he a?mosphere was gone, ?here was no more sound. As ?he bodies dri??ed, ?heir blood boiled in ?he vacuum and ?heir inner organs were vomi?ed ou?, un?il ?hey ?urned in?o s?range blobs surrounded by crys?alline clouds made ?rom ?he liquid ?hey exuded. Also, due ?o ?he lack o? an a?mosphere, ?he sky ?urned pi?ch black. Every?hing ?ha?
had ?loa?ed in?o space ?rom ?he Three Body world re?lec?ed ?he sunligh? and ?ormed a brillian?, s?arry cloud in space. The cloud ?hen ?urned in?o a gian?
vor?ex, spiraling ?oward i?s ?inal res?ing place: ?he sun.*

**A horror show on a planetary scale.

*“You asked abou? ?he appearance o? ?he Trisolarans ?us? now. According ?o some signs, ?he bodies o? ?he Trisolarans who ?ormed ?he compu?er were covered by a purely re?lec?ive sur?ace, which probably evolved as a response ?o survival under ex?reme condi?ions o? sunligh?. The mirrorlike sur?ace could be de?ormed in?o any shape, and ?hey communica?ed wi?h each o?her by ?ocusing ligh? wi?h ?heir bodies. This kind o? ligh?-speech could ?ransmi? in?orma?ion ex?remely rapidly and was ?he ?ounda?ion o? ?he Trisolaran-?orma?ion compu?er. O? course, ?his was s?ill a very ine??icien?
machine, bu? i? was capable o? comple?ing calcula?ions ?ha? were ?oo di??icul? ?o be per?ormed manually. The compu?er did in ?ac? make i?s ?irs?
appearance in Trisolaris as ?orma?ions o? people, be?ore becoming mechanical and ?hen elec?ronic.”*

**How would life ever get started on a planet like Trisolaris? Although we don't even know how it started on Earth.

*The sun had already se?. The Grea?er Khingan Moun?ains were gray and indis?inc?, ?us? like Ye’s li?e. In ?his gray li?e, a dream appeared especially color?ul and brigh?. Bu? one always awoke ?rom a dream, ?us? like ?he sun— which, ?hough i? would rise again, brough? no ?resh hope. In ?ha? momen?
Ye saw ?he res? o? her li?e su??used wi?h an endless grayness. Wi?h ?ears in her eyes, she smiled again, and con?inued ?o chew ?he cold mantou.
Ye didn’? know ?ha? a? ?ha? momen?, ?he ?irs? cry ?ha? could be heard in space ?rom civili?a?ion on Ear?h was already spreading ou? ?rom ?he sun ?o ?he universe a? ?he speed o? ligh?. A s?ar-powered radio wave, like a ma?es?ic ?ide, had already crossed ?he orbi? o? Jupi?er.
Righ? ?hen, a? ?he ?requency o? 12,000 MH?, ?he sun was ?he brigh?es?
s?ar in ?he en?ire Milky Way.*

**The juxtaposition of crushed expectations and unknowingly succeeding is just beautiful. For sure a quirk of possibilities that has a special frequency to it.

*In peace, wha? had been suppressed by anxie?y and ?ear began ?o reawaken. Ye ?ound ?ha? ?he real pain had ?us? begun. Nigh?marish memories, like embers coming back ?o li?e, burned more and more ?iercely, searing her hear?.*

**Trauma always seems to have a delayed impact. The defenses you build up while it's happening takes time to atrophy.

*Ye accep?ed Yang’s proposal mainly ou? o? gra?i?ude. I? he hadn’?
brough? her in?o ?his sa?e haven in her mos? perilous momen?, she would probably no longer be alive. Yang was a ?alen?ed man, cul?ured and wi?h good ?as?e. She didn’? ?ind him unpleasan?, bu? her hear? was like ashes ?rom which ?he ?lame o? love could no longer be li?.*

**It's a Zenlike state to have completely surrendered.

*INTERROGATOR: I wan? ?o ask a ques?ion, bu? I won’? record ?he answer. How did you ?eel a? ?he ?ime?
YE: Calm. I did i? wi?hou? ?eeling any?hing. I had ?inally ?ound a goal ?o which I could devo?e mysel?. I didn’? care wha? price had ?o be paid, ei?her by me or by o?hers. I also knew ?ha? ?he en?ire human race would pay an unpreceden?ed price ?or ?his goal. This was a very insigni?ican?
beginning.*

**What of our social operating would stay intact if it turned out that there was intelligence far superior to humanity?

*Leaving ?he moun?ains, Ye ?el? spring was everywhere. The cold win?er o? ?he Cul?ural Revolu?ion really was over, and every?hing was springing back ?o li?e. Even ?hough ?he calami?y had ?us? ended, every?hing was in ruins, and coun?less men and women were licking ?heir wounds.*

**The damage done to our landscape of ideas by a cultural calamity is deeper, sometimes, than the physical destruction done by a natural disaster.

*INTERROGATOR: Le?’s look a? ?he curren? composi?ion o? ?he ETO. The Adven?is?s would like ?o des?roy ?he human race by means o? an alien power; ?he Redemp?ionis?s worship ?he alien civili?a?ion as a god; ?he Survivors wish ?o be?ray o?her humans ?o buy ?heir own survival. None o? ?hese is in line wi?h your original ideal o? using ?he alien civili?a?ion as a way ?o re?orm humani?y.*

**A summary of the three different factions within ETO. Why are there always splits within revolutionary movements? There's something about the open plains that stirs up our thirst for conquering. A dopaminergic drive for opportunity.

*The lis?ener read over ?he message ?rom ?he Ear?h again. His ?hough?s dri??ed over ?he blue ocean ?ha? never ?ro?e and ?he green ?ores?s and ?ields, en?oying ?he warm sunligh? and ?he caress o? a cool bree?e. What a beautiful world! The paradise we imagined really exists!*

**Wouldn't their idea of what's beautiful be adapted to the environment they evolved in?

*“Given a ?ime gap o? ?or?y ?housand hours, ?he s?ra?egic value o? any ?radi?ional ?ac?ics o? war or ?error is insigni?ican?, and ?hey can recover ?rom ?hem. To e??ec?ively con?ain a civili?a?ion’s developmen? and disarm i?
across such a long span o? ?ime, ?here is only one way: kill i?s science.”
The science consul said, “The plan ?ocuses on emphasi?ing ?he nega?ive environmen?al e??ec?s o? scien?i?ic developmen? and showing signs o?
superna?ural power ?o ?he popula?ion o? Ear?h. In addi?ion ?o highligh?ing ?he nega?ive e??ec?s o? progress, we’ll also a??emp? ?o use a series o?

Trisolaran civili?a?ion may become a ?arge? o? religious worship ?here. Then, unscien?i?ic ways o? ?hinking will domina?e scien?i?ic ?hinking among human in?ellec?uals, and lead ?o ?he collapse o? ?he en?ire scien?i?ic sys?em o? ?hough?.”*

*Look a? ?hem, ?he bugs. Humans have used every?hing in ?heir power ?o ex?inguish ?hem: every kind o? poison, aerial sprays, in?roducing and cul?iva?ing ?heir na?ural preda?ors, searching ?or and des?roying ?heir eggs, using gene?ic modi?ica?ion ?o s?erili?e ?hem, burning wi?h ?ire, drowning wi?h wa?er. Every ?amily has bug spray, every desk has a ?lyswa??er under i? … ?his long war has been going on ?or ?he en?ire his?ory o? human civili?a?ion. Bu? ?he ou?come is s?ill in doub?. The bugs have no? been elimina?ed. They s?ill proudly live be?ween ?he heavens and ?he ear?h, and ?heir numbers have no? diminished ?rom ?he ?ime be?ore ?he appearance o?

The Trisolarans who deemed ?he humans bugs seemed ?o have ?orgo??en one ?ac?: The bugs have never been ?ruly de?ea?ed.*

**Any species that's still with us has proved their resilience. That includes our own.

*A small black cloud covered ?he sun and cas? a moving shadow agains?
