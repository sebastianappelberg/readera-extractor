*But not all conversations are equal. When a discussion is meaningful, it can feel wonderful, as if something important has been revealed. “Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or in friendship, is conversation,” wrote Oscar Wilde.*

**It's through communication that things can change.

*How do we create a genuine connection with another person? How do we nudge someone, through a conversation, to take a risk, embrace an adventure, accept a job, or go on a date?
Let’s lower the stakes. What if you’re trying to bond with your boss, or get to know a new friend: How do you convince them to let down their guard? How do you show you’re listening?*

**It's something we train all our lives without really knowing it.

*Alongside this new understanding, there’s also been a flurry of research showing that at the heart of every conversation is the potential for neurological synchronization, an alignment of our brains and bodies—everything from how fast each of us breathes to the goose bumps on our skin—that we often fail to notice, but which influences how we talk, hear, and think. Some people consistently fail to synchronize with others, even when they’re speaking to close friends.*

**Are there drawbacks to being able to sync easily with everyone? I'm thinking in terms of having a unique way of thinking. The less you understand others and they understand you, in a way your thinking is novel.

*When the musicians played their guitars separately, with each person focused on their own musical score, their neural activity looked dissimilar. But when they segued into a duet, the electrical pulses within their craniums began to synchronize. To the researchers, it appeared as if the guitarists’ minds had merged. What’s more, that linkage often flowed through their bodies: They frequently began breathing at similar rates, their eyes dilated in tandem, their hearts began to beat in similar patterns. Frequently even the electrical impulses along their skin would synchronize. Then, when they stopped playing together—as their scores diverged or they veered into solos—the “between-brain synchronization disappeared completely,” the scientists wrote.*

**How much of that was the coordinating power of the music itself? It could be that the same piece of music affects people the same when they try to play it.

*What’s more, some listeners synchronized particularly closely with the speaker; their brains seemed to behave nearly precisely like her brain. When questioned afterward, those tightly aligned participants could distinguish between the story’s characters more clearly and recall smaller details. The more people’s brains had synchronized, the better they understood what was said. The “extent of speaker-listener neural coupling predicts the success of the communication,” the researchers wrote in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2010.*

**Is there a tradeoff between depth and breadth? I.e to resonate with a broader audience you'll necessarily need to tread a path that doesn't resonate deeply with anyone? Or is this a false dichotomy?

*But when Sievers looked at the data, he found that strong leaders didn’t help people align. In fact, groups with a dominant leader had the least amount of neural synchrony. Participant 4 made it harder for his groupmates to sync up. When he dominated the conversation, he pushed everyone else into their own, separate thoughts.
Rather, the groups with the greatest synchrony had one or two people who behaved very differently from Participant 4. These people tended to speak less than dominant leaders, and when they did open their mouths, it was usually to ask questions. They repeated others’ ideas and were quick to admit their own confusion or make fun of themselves. They encouraged their groupmates (“That’s really smart! Tell me more about what you think!”) and laughed at others’ jokes. They didn’t stand out as particularly talkative or clever, but when they spoke, everyone listened closely. And, somehow, they made it easier for other people to speak up. They made conversations flow. Sievers began referring to these people as high centrality participants.*

**I'd call this the difference between superficial leaders and actual leaders. A leader doesn't want to lead, a leader just leads. Leading is not showy, it's subtle. It's about uniting, enhancing, and empowering. 

**Ask questions, make it easier for people to participate, don't monopolize conversations. 

---
Page: 28

*When a group got stuck, they made it easy for everyone to take a quick break by bringing up a new topic or interrupting an awkward silence with a joke.
But the most important difference between high centrality participants and everyone else was that the high centrality participants were constantly adjusting how they communicated, in order to match their companions. They subtly reflected shifts in other people’s moods and attitudes. When someone got serious, they matched that seriousness. When a discussion went light, they were the first to play along. They changed their minds frequently and let themselves be swayed by their groupmates.*

**Listen to the mood of the room. Quickly adapt and adapt in a way that creates room for people to be honest and creative or whatever is required by the circumstances.

*But they didn’t merely mirror others—rather, they gently led people, nudging them to hear one another, or to explain themselves more clearly. They matched their groupmates’ conversational styles, making room for seriousness or laughter, and invited others to match them in return. And they had enormous influence on how people ended up answering the questions they had been assigned.*

**Nudge people to clarify and create understanding. Use your communicative muscles to seek out the best way to get them to feel that they should participate and speak.

*So, to become a supercommunicator, all we need to do is listen closely to what’s said and unsaid, ask the right questions, recognize and match others’ moods, and make our own feelings easy for others to perceive.
Simple, right?*

**In a way it is simple, it should be like walking.

*The third conversational mindset—the social mindset—emerges when we discuss our relationships, how we are seen by others and see ourselves, and our social identities. These are Who Are We? discussions. When we, for instance, gossip about office politics, or figure out the people we know in common, or explain how our religion or family background—or any other identity—influences us, we’re using our brain’s default mode network, which plays a role in how we think “about other people, oneself, and the relation of oneself to other people,” as the neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman wrote. One 1997 study published in the journal Human Nature found that 70 percent of our conversations are social in nature. During those dialogues the social mindset is constantly shaping how we listen and what we say.*

**I think this is the mode least developed for me.

---
Page: 34

*It is important to note that matching isn’t mimicry. As you’ll see in the forthcoming chapters, we need to genuinely understand what someone is feeling, what they want, and who they are. And then, to match them, we need to know how to share ourselves in return. When we align, we start to connect, and that’s when a meaningful conversation begins.*

**I believe I rarely share myself in return and that it makes people feel that the conversation is lacking warmth and as such they're not sure how to proceed. 

---
Page: 33

*Happy couples “communicate agreement not with the speaker’s point of view or content, but with the speaker’s affect.” Happy couples ask each other more questions, repeat what the other person said, make tension-easing jokes, get serious together. The next time you feel yourself edging toward an argument, try asking your partner: “Do you want to talk about our emotions? Or do we need to make a decision together? Or is this about something else?”
The importance of this insight—that communication comes from connection and alignment—is so fundamental that it has become known as the matching principle: Effective communication requires recognizing what kind of conversation is occurring, and then matching each other.*

**Alignment seems to be more important than finesse.

*Happily married couples, successful negotiators, persuasive politicians, influential executives, and other kinds of supercommunicators tend to have a few behaviors in common. They are as interested in figuring out what kind of conversation everyone wants as the topics they hope to discuss. They ask more questions about others’ feelings and backgrounds. They talk about their own goals and emotions, and are quick to discuss their vulnerabilities, experiences, and the various identities they possess—and to ask others about their emotions and experiences. They inquire how others see the world, prove they are listening, and share their own perspectives in return.*

**Conversing is quite beautiful when you think about it.

---
Page: 44

*So the first goal in a learning conversation is identifying what kind of dialogue we’re seeking—and then looking for clues about what the other parties want.
This can be as simple as taking a moment to clarify, for yourself, what you hope to say and how you want to say it: “My goal is to ask Maria if she wants to vacation together, but in a way that makes it easy for her to say no.” Or it might consist of asking a spouse, as he describes a hard day, “Do you want me to suggest some solutions, or do you just need to vent?”*

**I got the impression that you should always follow the other person's lead but there are times when you're taking the initiative, how do you bring the person along and get them to match you?

---
Page: 45

*Before we phone a friend or chat with a spouse, we don’t need to write out a sentence about our goals, of course—but, if it’s an important conversation, taking a moment to formulate what we hope to say, and how we hope to say it, is a good idea. And then, during the discussion, try to observe your companions: Are they emotional? Do they seem practical minded? Do they keep bringing up other people or social topics?
We all send clues, as we speak and listen, about what kind of conversation we want. Supercommunicators notice these clues, and think a bit harder about where they hope a conversation will go.*

**You need to listen to understand whether the signals you're sending are being picked up correctly. 

**This seems like it could be quite a stiff process. I think that might be exaggerated and I think it'll only cause stiffness in the beginning, but the whole rest of the conversation may be better aligned for it.

*But first, they need to figure out how to start the conversation. They need to negotiate the unspoken rules for how they will speak and listen—and determine what everyone wants and needs. This is a negotiation we all participate in whenever a conversation begins, whether we realize it or not. And it’s more complicated than we think.*

**When you're aware of it you have more influence over it and you're better able to adapt to where it's going. 

---
Page: 54

*As the conversation started, how did you know what everyone wanted to discuss? Did someone announce a topic (“We need to decide who’s driving Aimee to school tomorrow”) or did a focus emerge gradually? (“Hey, just wondering, did Pablo seem distracted at dinner last night?”)
Once you figured out what to talk about, how did you intuit the conversation’s tone? How did you know if you should speak casually? If making jokes was appropriate? If it was okay to interrupt?
You probably didn’t think about those questions, and yet they all got answered somehow. When researchers have studied conversations, they’ve found a delicate, almost subconscious dance that usually occurs at a discussion’s start. This back-and-forth emerges via our tone of voice, how we hold our bodies, our asides and sighs and laughs. But until we arrive at a consensus on how a dialogue ought to proceed, the real conversation can’t begin.
Occasionally, a conversation’s aims are stated explicitly (“We’re here to discuss this quarter’s projections”) until we realize, midway through, that people’s real preoccupations lie elsewhere (“What we’re actually worried about is whether there’re going to be layoffs”). Sometimes we cycle through various starts—someone tells a joke; someone else gets overly formal; there’s an awkward silence until a third person takes the lead—and, eventually, the conversation’s focus is tacitly agreed upon.
Some researchers call this process a quiet negotiation: A subtle give-and-take over which topics we’ll dive into and which we’ll skirt around; the rules for how we’ll speak and listen.*

**Many times there's a bit of quiet in the beginning, then someone throws out a topic which usually is just a starting point and then it goes on from there. Why does it die right away sometimes? When throwing out an opener, how does one do that in a good inviting way? How does one follow up the best possible way? How does one avoid smalltalk? 

---
Page: 55

*However, regardless of how this quiet negotiation unfolds, the goals are the same: First, to decide what we all need from this conversation. Second, to determine how we will speak and make decisions. Or, put differently, to figure out: What does everyone want? And how will we make choices together?*

**What if the conversation has no goal? What if it's just talking shit and making jokes? What if it's just an exploration? I guess that'd be the goal then and how we make choices together is a bit on the improv side. 

---
Page: 55

*The What’s This Really About? conversation often emerges when we confront a decision. Sometimes, these decisions are about the conversation itself—Is it okay to openly disagree, or should we sugarcoat our differences?Is this a friendly chat or a serious talk? Other decisions ask us to think practically (“Should we submit an offer for the house?”) or make a judgment (“What do you think of Zoe’s work?”) or analyze a choice (“Do you want me to pick up the groceries or get the kids?”).
Underneath all those straightforward decisions are other, potentially more serious choices: If we openly disagree, can we remain friends?Can we afford to pay that much for a home?Is it fair for me to pick up the kids when I have so much work to do? Unless we come to a basic agreement about what we’re actually discussing, and how we should discuss it, it’s hard to make progress.
But once we know what everyone wants from a conversation, and how we’ll make decisions together, a more meaningful dialogue can emerge.*

**What are the most common decisions we make about conversations? What kind of conversations do I want to have with who and when? The number of different ways and situations seems almost combinatorially explosive. What are the fundamental heuristics we should be making use of? I suppose that too is contextual.

*Ehdaie’s biggest mistake was assuming, at the start of a conversation, that he knew what the patient wanted: Objective medical advice, an overview of options to make an informed choice.
“But you don’t want to begin a negotiation assuming you know what the other side wants,” Malhotra said. This is the first part of the What’s This Really About? conversation: Figuring out what everyone wants to talk about. The simplest method for uncovering everyone’s desires, of course, is simply asking What do you want? But that approach can fail if people don’t know, or are embarrassed to say, or aren’t certain how to express their desires, or worry that revealing too much will put them at a disadvantage.*

**Recognize that it's a negotiation, try to find out what desires the other parties have, do it by asking the right questions. Ask open-ended questions to make people share as much as they're comfortable sharing, share your own thoughts and open up to get them to feel comfortable to go deeper. 

**What do people usually think about when having conversations at parties?

*“it is increasingly recognized that there are cooperative ways of negotiating our differences and that even if a ‘win-win’ solution cannot be found, a wise agreement can still often be reached that is better for both sides.”
Since Getting to Yes was first published, hundreds of studies have found ample evidence to support this idea. Elite diplomats have explained that their goal at a bargaining table isn’t seizing victory, but rather convincing the other side to become collaborators in uncovering new solutions that no one thought of before. Negotiation, among its top practitioners, isn’t a battle. It’s an act of creativity.
This approach has become known as interest-based bargaining, and its first step looks a lot like what Boly did in the jury room or what Dr. Ehdaie did with his patients at Sloan Kettering: Ask open-ended questions and listen closely. Get people talking about how they see the world and what they value most. Even if you don’t learn, right away, what others are seeking—they might not know themselves—you’ll at least inspire them to listen back. “If you want the other side to appreciate your interests,” Fisher wrote, “begin by demonstrating that you appreciate theirs.”*

**We gain a whole lot of tools when see that figuring out what it's really about is a negotiation. 

---
Page: 68

*Frequently, the best way to figure out those rules is by testing out various conversational approaches, and seeing how others react. For instance, negotiators often conduct experiments—first I’ll interrupt you, and then I’ll be polite, and then I’ll bring up a new topic or make an unexpected concession, and watch what you do—until everyone decides, together, which norms are accepted, and how this conversation should unfold. These experiments can take the form of proposals or solutions, or unanticipated suggestions or new topics that are suddenly introduced. In each case, the goal is the same: To see if this probe reveals a path forward. “Great negotiators are artists,” said Michele Gelfand, a professor at Stanford’s business school. “They take conversations in unexpected directions.”
Among the surest methods for sparking this kind of experimentation is introducing new themes and questions to a discussion, adding items to the table until the conversation has changed enough that new possibilities are revealed. “If you’re negotiating over salaries, for instance, and you’re stuck,” Gelfand said, “then drag something new in: ‘We’ve been focused on wages, but what if, instead of increasing paychecks, we give everyone more sick days? What if we let them work from home?’ ”
“The challenge is not to eliminate conflict,” Fisher wrote in Getting to Yes, “but to transform it.” All of us conduct these kinds of experiments in our everyday conversations, frequently without realizing it. When we make a joke, or ask a probing question, or suddenly get serious or silly, we are, in a sense, conducting a test to see if our companions will accept our invitation, if they’ll play along.*

**Negotiation still has bad connotations for me but it's important to realize that it's not about winning, it's about jointly getting somewhere. 

---
Page: 74

*The first step of a quiet negotiation is figuring out what people want from a conversation. The second step is determining how we’re going to make choices together—and that means deciding if this is a rational conversation or an empathetic one. Are we going to make decisions through analysis and reason, or through empathy and narratives?*

**I'm guessing it's pretty fluid and that even in the same conversation with the same person you'll need to adapt. What are the signs to look for?

---
Page: 76

*Sometimes, the stories we hear are enough to help us see a situation through someone else’s eyes, to empathize and reconsider. At other times, dispassionate reason wins the day. But we can only make decisions together if we all agree on which kind of logic is most persuasive. Once we are aligned, our minds become more open to what others have to say.*

**Can it be as easy as explicitly stating which logic we should be using?

---
Page: 80

*Then, once we know what people want from a conversation, we next need to work out how to give it to them—how to engage in a quiet negotiation—so that their needs are met, as well as our own. That requires conducting experiments to reveal how we’ll make decisions together. This is the matching principle at work, recognizing what kind of conversation is occurring and then aligning with others, and inviting them to align with us. Boly and Ehdaie understood that matching isn’t mimicry; it’s not simply looking concerned and repeating back what others have said.
Rather, matching is understanding someone’s mindset—what kind of logic they find persuasive, what tone and approach makes sense to them—and then speaking their language. And it requires explaining clearly how we, ourselves, are thinking and making choices, so that others can match us in return. When someone describes a personal problem by telling a story, they are signaling they want our compassion rather than a solution. When they lay out all the facts analytically, they are signaling they are more interested in a rational conversation than an emotional one. We can all learn to get better at noticing these clues and conducting the experiments that reveal them.*

**How do you do this without appearing or straight up being manipulative? 

---
Page: 84

*When someone says something and then laughs afterward—even if it wasn’t funny—it’s a hint they’re enjoying the conversation. When someone makes noises as they listen (“Yeah,” “Uh-huh,” “Interesting”), it’s a sign they’re engaged, what linguists call backchanneling. When someone asks follow-up questions (“What do you mean?” “Why do you think he said that?”), it’s a clue they’re interested, whereas statements that change the subject (“Let me ask you about this other thing”) are hints they’re ready to move on.*

**How do people respond to what you're saying?

---
Page: 85

*We achieve this in four ways: By preparing ourselves before a conversation; by asking questions; by noticing clues during a conversation; and by experimenting and adding items to the table.*

**Share your goals and ask what others are seeking. 

---
Page: 87

*What are two topics you most want to discuss? 
What is one thing you hope to say that shows what you want to talk about? 
What is one question you will ask that reveals what others want?*

**Eventually you'll have these questions in the back of your mind without effort. 

---
Page: 86

*What are two topics you might discuss? (Being general is okay: Last night’s game and TV shows you like) 
What is one thing you hope to say? 
What is one question you will ask?*

**I guess the feeling of safety being prepared gives you is a way to minimize the risk of being flabbergasted in the midst of it. 

**How do you avoid letting your questions limit you and be your main focus? Seems like you'd be less able to listen and adapt to what's happening in the moment, especially if in a completely different direction than your questions. 

---
Page: 88

*Sometimes, we want others to go first. The easiest way to do that is by asking open-ended questions, just as Dr. Ehdaie did with his patients. And open-ended questions are easy to find, if you focus on:
Asking about someone’s beliefs or values (“How’d you decide to become a teacher?”) 
Asking someone to make a judgment (“Are you glad you went to law school?”) 
Asking about someone’s experiences (“What was it like to visit Europe?”) 
These kinds of questions don’t feel intrusive—asking “How’d you decide to become a teacher?” doesn’t seem overly personal—but it’s an invitation for someone to share their beliefs about education, or what they value in a job. “Are you glad you went to law school?” invites someone to reflect on their choices, rather than simply describing their work. Open-ended questions can be shallow or deep. But, as the next chapter explains, questions about values, beliefs, judgments, and experiences are extremely powerful—and easier to ask than we think.*

**Letting the other person start seems easier if you want to lead the conversation. 

---
Page: 90

*Do they become quiet, their expressions passive, their eyes fixed somewhere besides your face? Do they seem overly contemplative? Do they take in your comments without adding thoughts of their own? 
People often misperceive these responses as listening. But they usually aren’t. (In fact, as the next few chapters explain, listening is much more active.) These are signals that someone is declining our invitation and wants to talk about something else—in which case, you need to keep searching—and experimenting—to learn what everyone wants.*

**This feels kind of like your words land with a thud. They just feel muffled somehow, you can feel when it happens. 

---
Page: 92

*We can figure out which new topics and approaches might be fruitful by paying attention to:
Has someone told a story or made a joke? If so, they might be in an empathetic logic of similarities mindset. In this mindset, people aren’t looking to debate or analyze choices; they want to share, relate, and empathize. 
Or are they talking about plans and decisions, or evaluating options? Have they brought up politics or finances or choosing a place for next year’s vacation? (“Is Maine or Florida better in June?”) If so, they might be in a more practical logic of costs and benefits mindset, and you’re better off getting analytical yourself. 
Listen for attempts to change the topic. People tell us what they want to discuss through their non sequiturs, asides, and sudden shifts—or, put differently, through the experiments they conduct. If someone asks the same question in different ways, or if they abruptly introduce a new subject, it’s a sign they want to add something to the table and we’d be wise to let them proceed. 
Finally, experiment. Tell a joke. Ask an unexpected question. Introduce a new idea. Try interrupting, and then not interrupting. Watch to see if your companions play along. If they do, they’re hinting at how they want to make decisions together, the rules and norms they accept. They are signaling how they’d like this conversation to unfold.*

**I appreciate practical pointers like this. One part that's left out is to train your courage to experiment, to switch topics, to ask unexpected questions, etc.

*Many in the audience assumed that Epley would launch into a PowerPoint with a series of listening tactics: Always maintain eye contact. Nod encouragingly to show you’re paying attention. Smile a lot. In other words, the kinds of tips popular on late-night infomercials and social media accounts.
But Epley’s research indicated that such methods, particularly when forced, undermine real communication. Nodding doesn’t mean you’re listening. Constant smiling and eye contact can be a little…intense. Besides, Epley believed, everyone already knows how to listen closely. “You don’t need anyone to teach you how to listen to an interesting podcast or a good joke,” he told me. “When you’re in a great conversation, no one has a problem following along. When something is interesting, you listen without thinking about it.”*

**I've been guilty of exactly this. I exaggerate all of them and it's kind of draining. Effortless listening huh. But what if the person is talking about something boring? I suppose it's also your responsibility to move the conversation to something interesting.  

---
Page: 100

*Then Epley revealed the questions they would ask each other. There were three of them. The third one was: “Can you describe a time you cried in front of another person?”
“Oh, shit,” said someone in the front row. “This is going to be awful.”*

**Some questions are designed to force complete mode shifts. I suppose the other party will either accept or deny the invitation.

Page: 101

*if we acknowledge someone else’s vulnerability, and become vulnerable in return, we build trust, understanding, and connection. If you choose to embrace the How Do We Feel? conversation, you are harnessing a neurochemical process that powers our most important relationships.
How Do We Feel? is critical because it reveals what’s happening inside our heads, and opens a path to connection.*

**Is that all there is to connecting? What if you hit it off really well with some new people, how do you make sure there's an opportunity to connect more? There's some sort of deal that needs to be closed, what mode is that? 

---
Page: 105

*Now, as an adult, Epley wondered if the psychology textbooks had it wrong. Perhaps the correct approach wasn’t trying to put yourself in “someone else’s shoes.” That, after all, was impossible. Rather, maybe the best you can do is ask questions. Ask about people’s lives, about what they’re feeling, about their hopes and fears, and then listen for their struggles, disappointments, joys, and ambitions.
Hearing people describe their emotional lives is important because when we talk about our feelings, we’re describing not just what has happened to us, but why we made certain choices and how we make sense of the world. “When you describe how you feel, you’re giving someone a map of the things you care about,” Epley said. “That’s why I connected with my parents, because I finally understood what mattered to them. I understood they were scared and worried and just wanted me to be safe.”*

**Perspective taking is more like perspective guessing and it'll most likely be more of a projection of your own experiences onto the other person. Starting from the assumption that you don't know the other person's perspective will move you towards trying to find out about it. The best tool we have for that is questions.

Page: 107

*Researchers had learned that simply because two people had experiences or beliefs in common—they both went to the same church and both smoked, or were both atheists who hated tobacco—these similarities, on their own, were not enough to foster camaraderie. Studies had shown that instructing people to make small talk, or do puzzles together, or tell each other jokes, were all ineffectual at creating a sense of closeness. Merely informing study participants “We have taken great care in matching partners” and “we expect that you and your partner will like one another” did not necessarily mean people would like each other at all.*

**Surface level attributes are probably a pretty bad proxy for  how a person thinks and what values and beliefs he has. Even if someone goes to church they can have a completely unexpected view of spirituality.

Page: 108

*In fact, there was only one method the Arons tested that could reliably help strangers form a connection: A series of thirty-six questions that, as Elaine and Arthur Aron later wrote, elicited “sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure.”*

**Is connecting always about personal disclosure? 

---
Page: 110

*Eventually, the researchers figured out how to gauge if a question was likely to spark an emotional reply: Questions that asked about everyday experiences or uncontroversial opinions—such as “How did you celebrate last Halloween?” or “What is the best gift you ever received?”—tended to yield answers that were reliably unemotional.
In contrast, questions that pushed people to describe their beliefs, values, or meaningful experiences tended to result in emotional replies, even if the questions themselves didn’t seem all that emotional. These kinds of questions were powerful because they often prompted people to reveal vulnerabilities. When someone asks “What do you value most in a friendship?” (question sixteen), it might not seem particularly emotionally probing, but it frequently draws unexpectedly revealing replies about past incidents of hurt or betrayal, or expressions of love for friends, or other anxieties or pleasures. Such questions make ever-deepening follow-ups (“What did you say after he broke up with you?”) easy to ask.
Put another way, the difference between a shallow question and one that sparks an opportunity for emotional connection is vulnerability. And vulnerability is what makes How Do We Feel? so powerful.*

**I believe that once you've pushed someone towards showing vulnerability you have a strong responsibility to listen and reciprocate, otherwise it's like you've stolen something from them. 

---
Page: 113

*These thirty-six questions are effective because they help people match each other emotionally, and going back and forth encourages everyone to offer, and then reciprocate, vulnerability. This also demonstrates why mimicry isn’t enough. “Reciprocity is nuanced,” said Margaret Clark, a psychology professor at Yale. If someone reveals something devastating, like a scary diagnosis or the death of a parent, it doesn’t bring us together if we use that as an excuse to talk about our own health, or a family member who died long ago. “You don’t want to grab the spotlight,” Clark told me. Rather, reciprocity means thinking about how to show empathy. Sometimes it requires simply acknowledging someone’s emotions and showing them you care. “It’s being responsive to others’ needs,” Clark said.*

**Be conscious of the other person's feelings and give them room to feel understood and heard. Reciprocate in a way that recognizes their feelings, showing that you get it and if you don't get it, ask questions. 

---
Page: 111

*In the early 1990s, a series of experiments had shown that humans typically “synchronize their own emotions with the emotions expressed by those around them.” This synchronization is sometimes deliberate, like when we choose to empathize with another person; more often it is automatic, happening outside of our consciousness, causing us to tear up or get angry or proud on someone else’s behalf, whether we want to or not.
This contagion is at the root of the How Do We Feel? conversation, and it explains why emotions influence our dialogues, even when we don’t recognize them. “Emotional contagion is a fairly primitive process,” a study published in 2010 observed. “Men and women tend to ‘catch’ expressions of joy, love, anger, fear, and sadness.” Emotional contagion, scholars believe, evolved because it helped humans form bonds with other people. It begins almost at birth: One study found that “10-week-old infants could and would imitate their mothers’ facial expressions of happiness, sadness, and anger.” This instinct has evolved within our brains so that we’ll feel good when we connect with other people—and thus become more likely to build alliances and friendships, families and societies.*

**This must be the primary mechanism behind how we move each other. Is it something you can choose to lean into? 

---

*In other words, we become more susceptible to emotional contagion, and more emotionally contagious ourselves, when we share something that feels raw, something that another person might judge. We might not care about their judgment, we might forget it as soon as we hear it, but the act of exposing ourselves to someone’s scrutiny engenders a sense of intimacy. To get deep, we have to make an offering of our vulnerability. “The louder the emotion, the more likely that contagion will occur,” Amit Goldenberg, a Harvard psychology researcher, told me. “And vulnerability is one of our loudest emotions. We’re hardwired to notice it.”*

**Should you take a different approach than asking deep questions when you are the initiator of being vulnerable? How do you make it OK for the other person to ask deep questions? I suppose you need to feel them out and if they don't initiate you can take the lead.

*There was one other key finding in the Harvard study of speed daters: Follow-up questions are particularly powerful. “Follow-ups are a signal that you’re listening, that you want to know more,” one of the researchers, Michael Yeomans, told me. Follow-up questions make reciprocity easier (“Your favorite part of college was ultimate frisbee? Me too! Do you still love to play?”). “They allow self-disclosure without it seeming like self-obsession,” said Yeomans. “It makes a conversation flow.”*

**Follow-up questions are easy too. Just be a little bit curious about what the other person just said, there are a million things that are unknown to you about it so just pick the unknown you're curious about.

*Put another way, if you want to have a successful conversation with someone, you don’t have to ask them about their worst memories or how they prepare for telephone calls. You just have to ask them to describe how they feel about their life—rather than the facts of their life—and then ask lots of follow-ups.*

**Shallow questions should be the starting point for going deeper. You can go progressively deeper by using follow-up questions.

*“The best listeners aren’t just listening,” said Margaret Clark, the Yale psychologist. “They’re triggering emotions by asking questions, expressing their own emotions, doing things that prompt the other person to say something real.”*

**It's actually rather engaging to elicit emotions in conversations. 

---
Page: 121

*The researchers found that “questioners assumed that asking sensitive questions would make their conversation partners uncomfortable and would damage their relationships. But in fact, we consistently found that askers were wrong on both fronts.” Asking deep questions is easier than most people realize, and more rewarding than we expect.*

**Perhaps going slow isn't necessary?

*“It is easier to judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers,” the nineteenth-century thinker Pierre-Marc-Gaston de Lévis wrote, and yet he stayed silent on which questions, exactly, should be asked. Science has provided guidance: Ask others about their beliefs and values. Ask them about experiences and those moments that caused them to change. Ask how they feel, rather than about facts. Reframe your questions so they are deeper. Ask follow-ups. And as people expose their vulnerabilities, reveal something about yourself. It will be less uncomfortable than you imagine. It will be more fascinating than you think. And it might lead to a moment of true connection.*

**I think it's good to recognize that even with the perfect setup it might not lead to a deep connection, but without it it's guaranteed not to lead to it.

*Rather, people laughed because they wanted to connect with the person they were speaking with. The vast majority of laughs, Provine wrote, “seemed to follow rather banal remarks,” such as “Does anyone have a rubber band?”; “It was nice meeting you too”; and “I think I’m done.”
“Mutual playfulness, in-group feeling and positive emotional tone—not comedy—mark the social settings of most naturally occurring laughter,” Provine concluded. Laughter is powerful, he wrote, because it is contagious, “immediate and involuntary, involving the most direct communication possible between people: Brain to brain.”
We laugh, in other words, to show someone that we want to connect with them—and our companions laugh back to demonstrate they want to connect with us, as well. This is the same kind of reciprocity that powers the Fast Friends Procedure. It’s an example of emotional contagion. And so it follows that we exhibit emotional intelligence not just by hearing another person’s feelings, but by showing we have heard them. Laughter, and other nonlinguistic expressions such as gasps and sighs, or smiles and frowns, are embodiments of the matching principle, which says that we communicate by aligning our behaviors until our brains become entrained.*

**Thinking back on the way I use laughter I see what they mean. It's a positive vibe probe. 

---
Page: 136

*Simply mirroring someone doesn’t prove that we genuinely want to understand them. If you laugh loudly, and I merely smile, it won’t feel like I want to bond. It will feel like I’m uninterested, or patronizing. What matters isn’t speaking and acting alike, but rather matching one another in ways that convey the desire to align.
In one study published in 2016, participants who listened to one-second recordings of people laughing could accurately distinguish between friends laughing together, and strangers trying to laugh alike. Laughter, like many nonlinguistic expressions, is useful because it’s hard to fake.*

**It's like extending a peace pipe and accepting the peace pipe.

*One of the reasons supercommunicators are so talented at picking up on how others feel is because they have a habit of noticing the energy in others’ gestures, the volume of their voices, how fast they are speaking, their cadence and affect. They pay attention to whether someone’s posture indicates they are feeling down, or if they are so excited they can barely contain it. Supercommunicators allow themselves to match that energy and mood, or at least acknowledge it, and thereby make it clear they want to align. They help us see and hear our feelings via their own bodies and voices. By matching our mood and energy, they make it obvious they are trying to connect.*

**Mood and energy. I believe there's a gradient to both of them. I guess we're so sensitive to it that we can get within a pretty precise proximity of it when we're trying to match someone. 

**I think starting out from a place where you're genuinely extending yourself to the other for connecting is the core of hope.

Page: 144

*Did candidates make clear they were trying to align with his mood and energy? If the answer was yes, it indicated they probably took emotional communication seriously.
This framework offers lessons for the rest of us. It’s hard to tell exactly what someone is feeling, to know if they are angry or upset or frustrated or annoyed or some combination of all those emotions. The person, themself, might not know.
So instead of trying to decipher specific emotions, pay attention to someone’s mood (Do they seem negative or positive?) and their energy level (Are they high energy or low energy?). Then, focus on matching those two attributes—or, if matching will only exacerbate tensions, show that you hear their emotions by acknowledging how they feel. Make it obvious you are working to understand their emotions. And when you, yourself, are expressing your own emotions, notice how others are responding. Are they trying to align with your energy and mood?*

**If the person attempts to understand the other person, he is showing that he is aware of that dimension of social interaction. He might not be the best at it but he has the awareness to get better.

*The writers had finally cracked the code: The characters could be bumbling and graceless and socially incompetent—and as long as they obviously tried to match one another’s mood and energy (or deliberately didn’t match), it would be clear when they were connecting or at odds. The audience would understand what they were feeling and could root for them, celebrate when they bonded, feel good when everything worked out in the end*

**Mood and energy seem to be used as blunt force instruments to give the audience something to grab onto in terms of understanding how they should be matching the show in their heads.

*She had assumed that the goal of discussing a conflict and engaging in debate was achieving victory, defeating the other side. But that’s not right. Rather, the real goal is figuring out why a conflict exists in the first place.
Combatants—be they arguing spouses or battling coworkers—have to determine why this fight has emerged and what is fueling it, as well as the stories they are all telling themselves about why this conflict persists. They need to work together to determine if there are any “zones of possible agreement,” and have to arrive at a mutual understanding about why this dispute matters, and what’s needed for it to end. This kind of understanding, alone, won’t guarantee peace. But without it, peace is impossible.*

**Just having a different mindset will change your entire approach and way of thinking about what to say next. 

---
Page: 160

*So how do we achieve this kind of mutual understanding? The first step is recognizing that within each fight is not just one conflict, but, at a minimum, two: There’s the surface issue causing us to disagree with each other, and then the emotional conflict underneath. “Say you have a couple fighting with each other about having another kid,” Heen told me. “There’s the top-level conflict—you want another child, and I don’t—that seems, at first glance, to explain why they’re fighting. But there’s also a deeper emotional issue: I’m angry because you’re prioritizing a kid over my career or I’m scared another child will bankrupt us or I’m frustrated because you don’t seem to care what I want.” Those emotional conflicts are sometimes nebulous, difficult to pin down, but they’re also incredibly powerful—because they contain so much of the anger and disappointment driving this argument beyond the possibility of compromise.*

**Scratch beyond the surface level conflict and get to the bottom of why there's a conflict in the first place by finding the deep emotional conflict underneath it all. 

---
Page: 161

*The problem, however, is that we often hate talking about our feelings during a disagreement. “People love to pretend that they can become analytical robots,” Heen said. “But, of course, no one can do that. All that happens is your emotions leak out in other ways.” Or people might recognize their own emotions, but they are loath to reveal them. They think it will give the other side an advantage or will be viewed as a weakness. They worry about revealing a vulnerability that will be weaponized by their foes. Not to mention, when we’re fighting, we usually feel stressed, which isn’t a great environment for discussing our feelings.
This is the real reason why so many conflicts persist: Not because of a lack of solutions or because people are unwilling to compromise, but because combatants don’t understand why they are fighting in the first place. They haven’t discussed the deeper topics—the emotional issues—that are inflaming the dispute. And they’ve avoided that emotional discussion because they don’t want to admit they are furious and sad and worried.*

**Is there not some truth to it giving the other side an advantage? What if you're talking to someone that doesn't care about you at all? Like when you're debating strangers? I guess opening up emotionally is the fastest way to actually connect with them. The vulnerability may be outweighed by the speedup in connection.

*When we’re speaking, we’re frequently so focused on what we are saying that we don’t pick up on how our listeners are behaving. We miss the signals that listeners are trying to send to show they are following along.
So if a listener wants to prove they’re listening, they need to demonstrate it after the speaker finishes talking. If we want to show someone we’re paying attention, we need to prove, once that person has stopped speaking, that we have absorbed what they said.
And the best way to do that is by repeating, in our own words, what we just heard them say—and then asking if we got it right.
It’s a fairly simple technique—prove you are listening by asking the speaker questions, reflecting back what you just heard, and then seeking confirmation you understand—but studies show it is the single most effective technique for proving to someone that we want to hear them. It’s a formula sometimes called looping for understanding.[*]The goal is not to repeat what someone has said verbatim, but rather to distill the other person’s thoughts in your own words, prove you are working hard to understand and see their perspective—and then repeat the process, again and again, until everyone is satisfied.*

**I think I've stumbled naturally into this technique, though not only in discussions where there's conflict. It's an overall extremely useful technique for clarifying communication. 

---
Page: 164

*As one 2018 study put it, when someone proves they’re listening it creates “a sense of psychological safety because [the listener] instills a confidence in the speaker that at least their arguments will receive full consideration and will, thus, be evaluated based on their real worth.” When people believe that others are trying to understand their perspectives, they become more trusting, more willing “to express their thoughts and ideas.” The “sense of safety, value and acceptance” that comes from believing a partner is genuinely listening makes us more willing to reveal our own vulnerabilities and uncertainties. If you want someone to expose their emotions, the most important step is convincing them you are listening closely to what they say.*

**Being heard is a cornerstone for wanting to share emotional content. 

---
Page: 167

*Methods like looping for understanding, says Sheila Heen, are powerful because even when people lead very dissimilar lives, they can often find emotional similarities with one another. “We’ve all experienced fear and hope and anxiety and love,” she told me. By creating an environment where people are invited to discuss their emotions, and then prove to one another they want to understand, we foster trust, even among people accustomed to seeing each other as foes.*

**Universal human emotions are perhaps the surest thing to connect over.

*Eventually, the organizers in Washington, D.C., asked everyone to start discussing the issue that had brought them here: Guns. However, the conversation began in a curious way. Participants were asked to share a personal story explaining why this issue was so important to them. There were guidelines: People should tell stories about their own experiences and not about things they had heard or seen online. They were not to offer lessons or takeaways, only memories, feelings, and perceptions. As for the listeners, they could ask questions, but they had to be open ended and curious. No rebuttals disguised as inquiries; no asking a question when you think you already know the answer.*

**Your own experience is the truest thing you'll know. That doesn't mean facts are less worthy, but how does your life relate to those facts? How have you personally experienced it? Just stating how you see things keeps things relatively neutral and it invites people to listen and to reflect on it instead of knee-jerking to their programmed rebuttal. 

---
Page: 176

*But if, during moments of tension, we focus on things we can control together, conflicts are less likely to emerge. If we focus on controlling ourselves, our environment, and the conflict itself, then a fight often morphs into a conversation, where the goal is understanding, rather than winning points or wounding our foes. Control isn’t the only thing that matters, of course, but if spouses don’t feel like they share control, it’s difficult for an argument to end, or a relationship to flourish.
This insight also has significance in other realms: During any conflict—a workplace debate, an online disagreement—it’s natural to crave control. And sometimes that craving pushes us to want to control the most obvious target: The person we’re arguing with. If we can just force them to listen, they’ll finally hear what we’re saying. If we can force them to see things from our point of view, they’ll agree we’re right. The fact is, though, that approach almost never works. Trying to force someone to listen, or see our side, only inflames the battle.
Instead, it is far better to harness our craving for control so that we’re working together, cooperating to find ways to lower the temperature and make this fight smaller. Often, that cooperation spills into other parts of our dialogue, until we find ourselves looking at solutions, side by side.*

**As Forrest Landry puts it "maximizing each other's freedom is love".

*The next morning, Jeffcoat posted in support of a polarizing issue: Red flag laws, which allow police to remove guns from people’s homes. Jeffcoat knew her post would spark angry replies.
Godfrey, however, was ready. He responded before anyone else to say that, as a police officer and gun-rights supporter, there had been many times he had wished he could take a firearm from someone who posed a danger to themselves or others. Then he wrote that he hoped to hear about people’s experiences with this one specific sliver of the gun debate. He worked to shape the environment and the conflict’s boundaries. People began sharing stories about taking guns from relatives, or having their own guns taken away. Jeffcoat, rather than arguing her position, started looping, with posts summarizing what others had said. Soon, dozens of people were telling stories, admitting how complicated and nuanced this issue was. “Sometimes people don’t know how to listen,” Brittany Walker Pettigrew, a moderator, told me. “They think listening means debating, and if you let someone else make a good point, you’re doing something wrong. But listening means letting someone else tell their story and then, even if you don’t agree with them, trying to understand why they feel that way.”*

**Perhaps having prepared what kind of conversation they wanted it to be made it easier for others to know how to act? Perhaps that's one of the drivers of online conflict, the fact that the negotiations for what kind of conversation it's going to be never seem to settle properly. Forums can sometimes set those kinds of boundaries for us and it's clear that different forums have very different ways of discussing things.

Page: 179

*Attempts at control popped up in more subtle ways, as well. Someone would introduce an issue, and another person would immediately suggest a solution or offer a long monologue, which struck the original poster as an attempt to police the conversation’s direction and tone. Sometimes people downplayed issues—“I wouldn’t have seen the big deal in a situation like this,” one person wrote to another who described a troubling gun-training course—which felt like an attempt to control which kinds of concerns were legitimate and which ones were foolish.
Sometimes people didn’t even seem to realize they were trying to exert control.*

**Check yourself for attempts at controlling the other person. Control yourself, your environment and the conflict boundaries. Avoid kitchen-sinking.

*There were all the normal problems of online communication: Comments intended as sarcasm but read the wrong way; garbled phrasing that implied an offense the writer never intended; posts that seemed innocent to some but like fighting words to others. And one problem, in particular, that kept popping up was the same issue that marriage researchers had found was derailing spouses: On Facebook, people kept trying to control one another. These struggles for control weren’t the only thing disrupting conversations—but when they emerged, they tore dialogues apart.*

**Perhaps it's the chaotic nature of the medium that makes people more controlling?

*A deep question asks about someone’s values, beliefs, judgments, or experiences—rather than just facts. Don’t ask “Where do you work?” Instead, draw out feelings or experiences: “What’s the best part of your job?” (One 2021 study found a simple approach to generating deep questions: Before speaking, imagine you’re talking to a close friend. What question would you ask?) 
A deep question asks people to talk about how they feel. Sometimes this is easy: “How do you feel about…?” Or, we can prompt people to describe specific emotions: “Did it make you happy when…?” Or ask someone to analyze a situation’s emotions: “Why do you think he got angry?” Or empathize: “How would you feel if that happened to you?” 
Asking a deep question should feel like sharing. It should feel, a bit, like we’re revealing something about ourselves when we ask a deep question. This feeling might give us pause. But studies show people are nearly always happy to have been asked, and to have answered, a deep question.*

**This is how we generate deep questions. 

---
Page: 185

*Deep questions are particularly good at creating intimacy because they ask people to describe their beliefs, values, feelings, and experiences in ways that can reveal something vulnerable. And vulnerability sparks emotional contagion, which makes us more aligned.*

**Ask about the others' feelings and share your own. Create cognitive alignment and create meaningful conversations. 

---
Page: 186

*Mood: Do they seem upbeat or glum? How would you describe their expressions? Are they laughing, or shouting? Are they up or down? 
Energy: Are they high energy, or low energy? Quiet and withdrawn or talkative and expressive? If they seem happy, is it calm and content (low energy) or excited and outgoing (high energy)? If they are unhappy, are they sad (low energy) or agitated (high energy)?*

**How do we learn to interpret non-verbal cues? Mood and energy are great heuristics. 

---
Page: 189

*We reciprocate vulnerability by…
Looping for understanding, until you understand what someone is feeling. 
Looking for what someone needs: Do they want comfort? Empathy? Advice? Tough love? (If you don’t know the answer, loop more.) 
Asking permission. “Would it be okay if I told you how your words affect me?” or “Would you mind if I shared something from my own life?” or “Can I share how I’ve seen others handle this?” 
Giving something in return. This can be as simple as describing how you feel: “It makes me sad to hear you’re in pain,” or “I’m so happy for you,” or “I’m proud to be your friend.” 
Reciprocity isn’t about matching vulnerability to vulnerability, or sorrow to sorrow. Rather, it is being emotionally available, listening to how someone feels and what they need, and sharing our own emotional reactions.*

**Often times you read about how to be vulnerable, it's refreshing to hear how to respond to vulnerability. 

---
Page: 190

*When we are in conflict with someone…
First, acknowledge understanding. We do this through looping and statements such as “Let me make sure I understand.” 
Second, find specific points of agreement. Look for places where you can say “I agree with you” or “I think you’re right that…” These remind everyone that, though we may have differences, we want to be aligned. 
Finally, temper your claims. Don’t make sweeping statements such as “Everyone knows that’s not true” or “Your side always gets this wrong.” Rather, use words like somewhat or “It might be…” and speak about specific experiences (“I want to talk about why you left dishes in the sink last night”) rather than broad generalities (“I want to talk about how you never do your part around the house”). 
The goal is showing that the aim of this conversation is not winning, but understanding. You don’t need to avoid disagreements or downplay your own opinions. You can offer thoughts, advocate for your beliefs, even make arguments and challenge each other—as long as your goal is to understand, and be understood, rather than to win.*

**Winning implies rivalry, understanding implies collaboration.

Page: 191

*When talking online, remember to…
Overemphasize politeness. Numerous studies have shown that online tensions are lessened if at least one person is consistently polite. In one study, all it took was adding thanks and please to a series of online arguments—while everything else stayed the same—to reduce tensions. 
Underemphasize sarcasm. When we say something in a wry tone, it signals an irony our audience usually understands. When we type something sarcastic online, we typically hear these same inflections within our heads—but the people reading our comments do not. 
Express more gratitude, deference, greetings, apologies, and hedges. Studies demonstrate that when we are grateful (“That comment taught me a lot”), or solicitous (“I would love to hear your thoughts”), or preface comments with a greeting (“Hey!”), or apologize in advance (“I hope you don’t mind…”) or hedge our comments (“I think…”), online communication gets better. 
Avoid criticism in public forums. In another study, researchers found that giving negative feedback online backfires much more than in real life. It pushes people to write more negative things, and to start criticizing others more frequently. When we criticize others publicly online, we make bad behavior into a digital norm.*

**The medium affects how and what we should communicate in order to maximize understanding.

*Social identities, as one psychology textbook explains, are “that part of our self-concept that comes from our membership in social groups, the value we place on this membership, and what it means to us emotionally.” Our social identities emerge from a blend of influences: The pride or defensiveness we feel based on the friends we’ve chosen, the schools we’ve attended, the workplaces we’ve joined. It’s the obligations we feel because of our family legacies, how we grew up, or where we worship. All of us have a personal identity, how we think of ourselves apart from society. And all of us have a social identity, how we see ourselves—and believe others see us—as members of various tribes.*

**Reducing yourself and others to what group you belong to is the problem. I'd try to connect over something else first.

*If Rosenbloom hoped to talk about vaccines with the vaccine resistant, he would need to get better at speaking their language and showing he understood their concerns. In other words, he needed to start having Who Are We? conversations.
But that required two things:
First, he needed to figure out how to address the stereotypes inside his own head—and the heads of other physicians—that made them see the vaccine resistant as ignorant and irresponsible. 
Second, he needed to have conversations where patients felt respected, and everyone saw one another as members of a common tribe.*

**If the point of these conversations is to reduce in-group out-group dynamics then I'm all for it.

*On the English tests, the men and women, on average, scored equally. On the math exams, however, men outscored women by an average of twenty points. During the English tests, both women and men budgeted their time wisely. On the math exam women seemed to work less efficiently. “They would double-check their answers more often and re-do calculations,” Steele said. They ran out of time “because they were multitasking, with part of their brains trying to answer the questions, and part thinking, I need to double-check, I need to be careful, because I know there’s this stereotype.”*

**What made them think that was the reason? Couldn't it be something else?

*(In contrast, when Black students were told that the test didn’t evaluate intellectual ability, reducing the salience of the stereotype, they scored similarly to white students.)*

**Now the causal chain has some credence to it.

Page: 210

*But the women in group three, who had been pushed to think about all the various facets of their lives and all the identities they possessed, ended up performing just as well as men. There was no difference in scores. The stereotype threat had been neutralized by reminding women of the multitudes of identities they possessed. “Drawing self-concept maps with few nodes proved ineffective,” the researchers wrote. “Drawing self-concept maps with many nodes, in contrast, allowed women who had been placed under stereotype threat to perform significantly better.”*

**We're more complex than we can describe and we're changing all the time. Think about that instead, think about endlessly rich and deep you and other people's circumstances are.

Page: 211

*It’s crucial, in a Who Are We? conversation, to remind ourselves that we all possess multiple identities: We are parents but also siblings; experts in some topics and novices in others; friends and coworkers and people who love dogs but hate to jog. We are all of these simultaneously, so no one stereotype describes us fully. We all contain multitudes that are just waiting to be expressed.
This means that a Who Are We? discussion might need to be more meandering and exploratory. Or it might need to go deep and invite others to talk about where they come from, how they see themselves, how the prejudices they confront—racism, sexism, the expectations of parents and communities—have impacted their lives. “When my son goes to school, I tell him, remember, that test may be hard today, but think about who else you are,” said Gresky, the researcher at Texas Christian University. “We can make the bad voices in our head less powerful by remembering all the other voices in there, too.”
The process for drawing out those voices is relatively straightforward: In a Who Are We? conversation, invite people to talk about their backgrounds, allegiances, how their communities have shaped them. (“Where are you from? Oh, really? What was it like growing up there?”) Then, reciprocate by describing how you see yourself. (“You know, as a southerner, I think that…”) Finally, avoid the trap of one-dimensionality by evoking all the many identities we all possess as a conversation unfolds: “I hear you saying that, as a lawyer, you support the police, but as a parent, do you worry about cops pulling over your kid?”
This, of course, is only one part of a Who Are We? conversation. Remembering that we all contain multitudes can help us see each other more clearly—but it won’t necessarily convince, say, a vaccine-resistant parent to trust a doctor.
To do that, we need to find an identity we can share.*

**If you dig deep enough there'll be some overlap. We shouldn't ignore whatever makes us understand the other person better as well as help them understand you. Even for you to understand yourself. 

---
Page: 217

*These kinds of environmental shifts point to what is needed for a successful Who Are We? conversation:
First, try to draw out your conversational partners’ multiple identities. It’s important to remind everyone that we all contain multitudes; none of us is one-dimensional. Acknowledging those complexities during a conversation helps disrupt the stereotypes within our heads.
Second, try to ensure everyone is on equal footing. Don’t offer unsolicited advice or trumpet your wealth or connections. Seek out topics where everyone has some experience and knowledge, or everyone is a novice. Encourage the quiet to speak and the talkative to listen, so everyone is participating.
Finally, look for social similarities that already exist. We do this naturally when we meet someone new and start searching for people we know in common. But it is important to take those connections a step further and make our commonalities more salient. Our similarities become powerful when they are rooted in something meaningful: We may both be friends with Jim, but that’s not much of a connection—until we start talking about what his friendship means to us, how Jim is an important part of both our lives. We may all be Lakers fans, but that only becomes powerful when we share what it felt like, for each of us, to go to games with our parents and watch Magic score, how we share the memory of that thrill.*

**Highlight each person's complexity. Put everyone on equal footing, if there's a power imbalance then address it. Create new groups by building on existing identities, make commonalities more salient.

*motivational interviewing, a method originally developed in the 1980s to help problem drinkers. In motivational interviewing, a 2012 paper explains, “counselors rarely attempt to convince or persuade. Instead, the counselor subtly guides the client to think about and verbally express their own reasons for and against change.” Motivational interviewing seeks to draw out a person’s beliefs, values, and social identities, in the hopes that, once all these complexities and complicated beliefs are on the table, unexpected opportunities for change might appear.*

**The first step is to listen, then the other party will listen themselves, then it's about helping them understand themselves and their position better, then it's about connecting and sharing knowledge, showing curiosity and collaborate.

*The Who Are We? conversation is crucial because our social identities exert such a powerful influence on what we say, how we hear, and what we think, even when we don’t want them to. Our identities can help us find values we share or can push us into stereotypes. Sometimes, simply reminding ourselves that we all contain multitudes can shift how we speak and listen. The Who Are We? conversation can help us understand how the identities we choose, and the identities imposed on us by society, make us who we are.*

**How big is the impact of social identities? How much does it affect our agency for the worse?

*The culture deck was amended to note that “silent disagreement is unacceptable.” Hastings went so far as to tell workers that “it is disloyal to Netflix when you disagree with an idea and do not express that disagreement” and that they ought to “farm for dissent” among their peers. Before long, meetings were filled with people tearing apart one another’s proposals. Teams would schedule “feedback dinners” where everyone would go around the table offering something they appreciated—and the five or six things they did not appreciate—about each of their coworkers.*

**I'd like to have a culture like that at one of my future companies.

*Another examination of three decades of data concluded that “the positive effects of diversity training rarely last beyond a day or two, and…can activate bias or spark a backlash.” A fourth study found that after unconscious bias training, “the likelihood that Black men and women would advance in organizations often decreased,” because the trainings made race and gender stereotypes more salient. A summary in the 2021 Annual Review of Psychology found that while, “by many metrics, the study of interventions designed to reduce prejudice is thriving,” the authors “conclude that much research effort is theoretically and empirically misguided if the aim is to provide actionable, robust, evidence-based recommendations for reducing prejudice in the world.”
This does not, by any means, suggest that efforts at addressing inequity or rooting out prejudice should be abandoned. It does not mean that reducing bias and structural injustice is impossible. There are real insights—as we saw with stereotype threat—that can help historically marginalized people succeed. There are interventions—such as those that took place on the soccer fields in Qaraqosh, Iraq—that have bridged differences.
However, figuring out precisely how to confront inequality and prejudice is more complicated than hiring a diversity consultant or asking workers to attend an afternoon training session. And these complications are heightened by the fact that many people feel that discussing Who Are We? poses real risks.*

**The problem with diversity programs is that often times they want to make themselves immune to critique by claiming that only bigots would oppose it. And it's clear that it's a way too simplistic solution.

*If a speaker said something that lumped a listener into a group against her or his will, the discussion would likely go south.
Sometimes speakers would assign listeners membership in a group they didn’t like—“You’re rich, so you know most rich people are snobs”—and the listener would be offended by the insinuation they were snobbish. Sometimes a speaker would deny someone membership in a group they esteemed—“You didn’t go to law school, so you don’t understand how the law actually works”—and the listener would be insulted by the accusation that they were uninformed.
Sometimes, when speakers made such comments, they were indirect: “You’re one of the good Republicans, but most of them only care about themselves” or “You got into that college because you’re smart, but some people like you get in because of affirmative action.” Occasionally the person making the comment seemed to have no idea they were offending: “Since you don’t have kids, you might not understand how a parent feels seeing a child treated that way.” Regardless of the phrasing, the result was consistent: Anger and alienation, a conversation that fell apart.*

**Is it not up to the listener to be confident in their own knowledge of who they are?

*But the researchers suspected that simply getting someone to acknowledge to themselves, up front, that a conversation about race or ethnicity can be uncomfortable might make that discomfort easier to withstand. And pushing people to think about the structure of their conversation—their hopes for the dialogue; what tensions might appear and how to handle them—might make those obstacles less likely or intimidating.
Put differently, the researchers hypothesized that nudging participants to think, just a little harder, about how a conversation will unfold, before it starts, might make identity threats a bit less threatening.*

**I guess it's not surprising that prompting for self-reflection works as a tool against knee-jerk reactions.

*However, when we describe our own experiences, feelings, and reactions—when we feel safe enough to reveal who we are—we start to neutralize identity threats. This requires some work, because avoiding generalizations means not only describing ourselves with honesty, but also listening closely to our companions so we can hear their specific pain and frustrations. We must not give in to the temptation to minimize someone’s struggles, or try to solve their problems, simply because witnessing their discomfort is so difficult. We must not imply that, because we have not personally experienced their suffering, it therefore is not real.
But when we embrace how others see the world and their identities within it, when we listen to their specific stories and acknowledge their feelings, we start to understand why two people, who otherwise agree about so much, might see some aspects of life—like policing, or parenting, or romantic relationships—so differently because of their dissimilar backgrounds. We begin to appreciate how our worlds have been shaped by our upbringings, our race and ethnicity, our gender, and other identities. We start to understand how much discussing Who Are We? can reveal. We begin to connect.*

**Being genuinely curious about the other person's experiences helps you understand them and get closer to them.

*Everyone was encouraged to speak—it wasn’t fair for some people to do the work of describing their lives, while others observed—and to reflect on how race and ethnicity and gender and other markers of identity had shaped their lives. This was important: Everyone has a racial and ethnic identity, employees were told, as well as a gender identity and a multitude of other selves. All of us can recognize the sting of exclusion. This commonality, instead of dividing us, can help us empathize.*

**Why make that part of ourselves the most salient one?

*Davis later told me that, in these kinds of conversations, what’s important is realizing how we might inadvertently contribute to problems like inequality. The aim is not to say the exact right thing, or to arrive at the perfect insight. Perfection can’t be the goal, “because if you’re trying to say the perfect thing, nothing authentic is going to happen,” he said. “The goal is staying in the conversation, finding space for messy learning and supporting each other.”*

**This is probably the most important point for virtue signaling to stop.

*It is important to note that these kinds of discussions will almost never be perfect. But perfection is not the goal. As Myers told me, “most of the work is about gaining awareness of yourself, your culture, and the culture of others.” The goal is to recognize our own biases, “who we might be excluding or including.”
Or, as Kiara Sanchez put it, the aim is not to “neutralize the discomfort, but rather give people a framework for persevering through it. It seems like a minor distinction, but the underlying theory is that discomfort can be helpful.” Discomfort pushes us to think before we speak, to try to understand how others see or hear things differently. Discomfort reminds us to keep going, that the goal is worth the challenge.*

**You can't avoid the discomfort but you can get better at dealing with it.

*What do you hope to accomplish? What do you most want to say? What do you hope to learn? What do you think others hope to say and learn? If we have elucidated goals before a discussion, we’re more likely to achieve them. 
How will this conversation start? How will you ensure that everyone has a voice and feels they can participate? What is needed to draw everyone in? 
What obstacles might emerge? Will people get angry? Withdrawn? Will a hesitancy to say something controversial prevent us from saying what’s necessary? How can we make it safer for everyone to air their thoughts? 
When those obstacles appear, what’s the plan? Research shows that being preemptively aware of situations that make us anxious or fearful can lower the impact of those concerns. How will you calm yourself and others if the conversation gets tense, or encourage someone who has gone quiet to participate more? 
Finally, what are the benefits of this dialogue? Are they worth the risks? (The answer usually is yes.) When people get angry or upset, or it’s easier to walk away, how will you remind yourself and others why this dialogue is so important?*

**I think this list can definitely be elaborated.

*First, establish guidelines. It is useful to make clear the norms—for instance, no one is allowed to blame, shame, or attack others. The goal is to share our feelings, not litigate who is at fault. It is also helpful to define if asking questions is okay, and if there are some kinds of inquiries—about, say, very personal topics, or particularly sensitive issues—that require some forethought. We should affirm that everyone is encouraged to speak, that everyone belongs in this discussion, and perhaps identify someone to serve as a moderator to make sure everyone is given space. Finally, it is useful to ask people to speak about their own experiences and describe their own stories. Don’t generalize. Don’t solve or diminish others’ problems, unless they ask for help. When a colleague describes something painful, listen, and tell them you’re sorry it happened. Acknowledge what they felt. 
Second, draw out everyone’s goals. You likely have some aims in mind. Share them. Then, ask others what they hope to get out of this discussion. Identify emotional goals (“I want to make sure we stay friends” or “I need to get something off my chest”); and practical goals (“I’d like to walk away from this with a plan”); as well as group goals (“It’s important to me that we all show compassion for each other”). 
Finally, acknowledge, and keep acknowledging, that discomfort is natural—and useful. We will misspeak. We will ask naïve questions. We will say things we didn’t realize were offensive. When these discomforts emerge, rather than shutting down, we should use them as opportunities to learn.*

**I gotta be honest, I have a hard time saying sorry that something happened if they think something ridiculous was traumatizing. It's a slap in the face of people who've gone through something real.

*Draw out multiple identities. Ask people about their backgrounds, communities, the organizations and causes they support, and where they come from. Share your identities in return. We all contain multiple selves; none of us are one-dimensional. It helps to be reminded of that. 
Work to ensure everyone is on an equal footing. Who Are We? discussions work best when everyone has an equal voice and the ability to speak. Focus on welcoming everyone’s perspective. Don’t trumpet your wealth or connections, your privilege or seniority, your expertise. Seek to frame topics so everyone is an expert, or everyone a novice. (This, in fact, is why discussing experiences is so powerful: We’re all experts in what we’ve seen and felt.) 
Acknowledge people’s experiences and look for genuine similarities. Ask people about their identities and build on what you have in common. (“You went to Valley High? So did I!”) But remember: Similarities must be genuine. And connections become more meaningful when we push them a bit further, and use them to understand each other better. (“High school was tough for me. What was it like for you?”) Even if we don’t have similarities, simply acknowledging others’ experiences—showing you have heard them—can create a sense of togetherness. 
Manage your environment. Social identities gain and lose power based on their salience and the environment where a conversation occurs. Sometimes a simple shift—moving a discussion from a group setting to something more personal; talking away from the workplace; starting a meeting by discussing the weekend before getting to business—can shift what feels safe, and who feels welcomed. (And, by the same token, when an environment makes someone feel left out, it can undermine our sense of safety.)*

**Don't stay at surface level similarities, use it to dig deeper. How do the surface level similarities connect you at a deeper level? 

**People are not only one thing, they're an uncountable number of things. Treat them as such, treat yourself as such.

*Another researcher put it more bluntly: “The most important influence, by far, on a flourishing life is love.” Not romantic love, but, rather, the kinds of deep connections we form with our families, friends, and coworkers, as well as neighbors and people from our community. “Love early in life facilitates not only love later on, but also the other trappings of success, such as prestige and even high income. It also encourages the development of coping styles that facilitate intimacy, as opposed to ones that discourage it.”
Participants who ended up happy all had “warm adult relationships” with numerous people. They had good marriages, were close to their children, and had invested in strong friendships. The people “who flourished found love,” one researcher observed, “and that was why they flourished.”*

**If you don't actively invest in your relationships they won't grow.

*“My professional life hasn’t been disappointing—far from it—but the truly gratifying unfolding has been into the person I’ve slowly become,” he wrote on a survey at the age of seventy-five. “Connectedness is something we must let happen to us…. What durable and pliable creatures we are, and what a storehouse of goodwill lurks in the social fabric.” Talking to other people, connecting with them, sharing his joys and sorrows, he said, had transformed his life. “You know what I learned?” he told one interviewer. “I learned love.”*

**One concern I have is that you don't get any time for becoming better at something. Although if you spend time talking to other people that are doing whatever you want to get better at, it may even out.

*Most of all, it has convinced me of the importance of having learning conversations, where my aim is to pay attention to what kind of conversation is occurring; to identify our goals for a dialogue; to ask about others’ emotions and share my own feelings; and to explore if our identities influence what we say and hear.*

**Be mindful of the communication that you participate in.

*But what’s important is wanting to connect, wanting to understand someone, wanting to have a deep conversation, even when it is hard and scary, or when it would be so much easier to walk away. There are skills and insights that can help us satisfy that desire for connection, and they are worth learning, practicing, and committing to. Because whether we call it love, or friendship, or simply having a great conversation, achieving connection—authentic, meaningful connection—is the most important thing in life.*

**I'd extend the notion of meaningful conversation to the kind of interaction you have with a book as a reader and to your audience as a writer.
