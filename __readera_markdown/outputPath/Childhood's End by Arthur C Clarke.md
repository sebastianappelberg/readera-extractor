*Schneider wondered if that was true, but decided it was much safer to express no doubts. 
That might start Grigorievitch's mind exploring far too many tortuous channels, and if there had been a leak, he would find it hard enough to clear himself*

**Censoring of the mind caused by a blame culture.

*Apart from such isolated incidents, the human race had accepted the Overlords as part of the natural order of things. In a surprisingly short time, the initial shock had worn off, and the world went about its business again.*

**The most extraordinary of events becomes old after a while.

*"That, Rikki, is the fear that torments them, even though they will never admit it openly. 
Believe me, it gives us no pleasure to destroy men's faiths, but all the world's religions cannot be right-and they know it. Sooner or later man has to learn the truth: but that time is not yet.*

**Our religions try to explain the ineffable, it's funny how bad we are at doing it.

*Yet, taken one at a time, I don't think his mental gifts are quite outside the range of human achievement. But no man could possibly do all the things he does.*

**Kind of like ChatGPT.

*With the arrival of the Overlords, nations knew that they need no longer fear each other, and they guessed-even before the experiment was made-that their existing weapons were certainly impotent against a civilization that could bridge the stars. So at once the greatest single obstacle to the happiness of mankind had been removed.*

**Had trisolaris not announced themselves on the way, would earth have united as one when they suddenly appeared in the sky?

*The Overlords seemed largely indifferent to forms of government, provided that they were not oppressive or corrupt. Earth still possessed democracies, monarchies, benevolent dictatorships, communism and capitalism. This was a source of great surprise to many simple souls who were quite convinced that theirs was the only possible way of life.*

**Perhaps the answer is that all different ways are needed?

*Or perhaps-this was van Ryberg's theory-he had merely been consulting some vast computing machine which could predict the outcome of any political action.*

**It's like Mimaroben from Aniara.

*Karellen was doing almost all the talking, weaving the intricate sentences which he was occasionally prone to use. Once this had seemed to Stormgren the most wonderful and certainly the most unexpected of all Karellen's gifts. Now it no longer appeared quite so marvellous, for he knew that like most of the Supervisor's abilities it was the result of sheer intellectual power and not of any special talent.*

**What would the world look like if everybody was at least as intellectually capable as the smartest person on earth from today?

*Indeed, since it is always valuable to know what your opponents are doing, the League is a very useful institution. Should it ever get into financial difficulties I might even have to subsidize it.*

**Your domination of something is complete when you are the one keeping it alive.

*"You have often asked me about our long-term plans," he continued. "The foundation of the World State is, of course, only the first step. You will live to see its completion-but the change will be so imperceptible that few will notice it when it comes. After that there will be a period of slow consolidation while your race becomes prepared for us. And thenwill comethe day which we have promised. lain sorry you will not be there."
Stormgren's eyes were open, but his gaze was fixed far beyond the dark barrier of the screen. He was looking into the future, imagining the day that he would never see, when the great ships of the Overlords came down at last to Earth and were thrown open to the waiting world.
 "On that day," continued Karellen, "the human race will experience what can only be called a psychological discontinuity. But no permanent harm will be done: the men of that age will be more stable than their grandfathers. We will always have been part of their lives, and when they meet us we will not seem so-strange-as we would do to you."*

**This is long-term planning for real. Taking generations into consideration. Is it ever wise to do that? I suppose when you understand a system well enough, it's possible to predict. But as with most complex adaptive systems, they are highly non-linear and should be impossible to predict.

*And Stormgren hoped that when Karellen was free to walk once more on Earth, he would one day come to these northern forests, and stand beside the grave of the first man to be his friend.*

**So Karellen is a creature whose origin is Earth?

*"All political problems," Karellen had once told Stormgren, "can be solved by the correct application of power."
"That sounds a rather cynical remark," Stormgren had replied doubtfully. "It's a little too much like 'Might is Right'. In our own past, the use of power has been notably unsuccessflu in solving anything."
"The operative word is correct. You have never possessed real power, or the knowledge necessary to apply it. As in all problems, there are efficient and inefficient approaches. 
Suppose, for example, that one of your nations, led by some fanatical ruler, tried to revolt against me. The highly inefficient answer to such a threat would be some billions of horsepower in the shape of atomic bombs. If I used enough bombs, the solution would be complete and fin√®i. It would also, as I remarked, be inefficient-even if it possessed no other defects."*

**It reminds me a little bit about Socrates in the sense that the key to everything is knowledge. The more knowledge you have the braver you are, the happier you are, the more virtuous you are, etc.

*By the standards of all earlier ages, it was Utopia. Ignorance, disease, poverty and fear had virtually ceased to exist. The memory of war was fading into the past as a nightmare vanishes with the dawn: soon it would lie outside the experience of all living men.
With the energies of mankind directed into constructive channels, the face of the world had been remade. It was, almost literally, a new world. The cities that had been good enough for earlier generations had been rebuilt-or deserted and left as museum specimens when they had ceased t~ serve any useful purpose. Many cities had already been abandoned in this manner, for the whole pattern of industry and commerce had changed completely. Production had become largely automatic: the robot factories poured forth consumer goods in such unending streams that all the ordinary necessities of life were virtually free. Men worked for the sake of the luxuries they desired: or they did not work at all.*

**It's funny that creatures that look like Satan brought heaven to earth.

Page: 52

*One of the most noticeable changes had been a slowing-down of the mad tempo that had so characterized the twentieth century. Life was more leisurely than it had been for generations. It therefore had less zest for the few, but more tranquillity for the many. 
Western man had relearned-what the rest of the world had never forgotten-that there was nothing sinful in leisure as long as it did not degenerate into mere sloth.*

**Interesting, many other cultures are more accepting of leisure. Spain for example.

Page: 52

*Whatever problems the future might bring, time did not yet hang heavy on humanity's hands. Education was now much more thorough and much more protracted. Few people left college before twenty-and that was merely the first stage, since they normally returned again at twenty-five for at least three more years, after travel and experience had broadened their minds. Even then, they would probably take refresher ~urses at intervals for the remainder of their lives in the subjects that particularly interested them.
This extension of human apprenticeship so far past the beginning of physical maturity had given rise to many social changes. Some of these had been necessary for generations, but earlier periods had refused to face the challenge-or had pretended that it did not exist. In particular, the pattern of sexual mores-insofar as there had ever been a single pattern- had altered radically. It had been virtually shattered by two inventions, which were, ironically enough, of purely human origin and owed nothing to the Overlords.*

**If we turn immortal, I would want this way of life.

*The instrument he handed over on permanent loan to the World History Foundation was nothing more than a television receiver with an elaborate set of controls for determining coordinates in time and space. It must have been linked somehow to a far more complex machine, operating on principles that no-one could imagine, aboard Karellen's ship. One had merely to adjust the controls, and a window into the past was opened up. Almost the whole of human history for the past five thousand years became accessible in an instant. 
Earlier than that the machine would not go, and there were baffling blanks all down the ages. They might have had some natural cause, or they might be due to deliberate censorship by the Overlords.
Though it had always been obvious to any rational mind that all the world's religious writings could not be true, the shock was nevertheless profound. Here was a revelation which no-one could doubt or deny: here, seen by some unknown magic of Overlord science, were the true beginnings of all the world's great faiths. Most of them were noble and inspiring- but that was not enough. Within a few days, all mankind's multitudinous messiahs had lost their divinity. Beneath the fierce and passionless light of truth, faiths that had sustained millions for twice a thousand years vanished like morning dew. All the good and all the evil they had wrought were swept suddenly into the past, and could touch the minds of men no more.*

**Religion's obscurity is a great asset to it, it puts a veil of mysticism over it that let's it's proponents wield it very flexibly to convince people.

*The end of strife and conflicts of all kinds had also meant the virtual end of creative art. 
There were myriads of performers, amateur and professional, yet there had, been no really outstanding new works of literature, music, painting or sculpture for a generation. 
The world was still living on the glories of a past that could never return.
No-one worried except a few philosophers. The race was too intent upon savouring its new-found freedom to look beyond the pleasures of the present. Utopia was here at last: 
its novelty had not yet been assailed by the supreme enemy of all Utopias-boredom.
Perhaps the Overlords had the answer to that, as they had to all other problems. No-one knew-any more than they knew, a lifetime after their arrival-what their ultimate purpose might be. Mankind had grown to trust them, and to accept without question the superhuman altruism that had kept Karellen and his companions so long exiled from their homes.*

**Is utopia the end of art? Is art dependent on oscillating polarities? On chaos? Is handing over the responsibility of your life into someone else's hands a sure way of forgetting how to live and be strong?

*Man was, therefore, still a prisoner on his own planet. It was a much fairer, but a much smaller, planet than it had been a century before. When the Overlords had abolished war and hunger and disease, they had also abolished adventure.*

**Curbing our curiosity is bound to make us miserable. And when we're miserable it colors all content of consciousness.

*London had changed enormously in the last fifty years. It now contained scarcely two million people, and a hundred times as many machines. It was no longer a great port, for with every country producing almost all its needs, the entire pattern of world trade had been altered. There were some goods that certain countries still made best, but they went directly by air to their destinations. The trade routes that had once converged on the great harbours, and later on the great airports, had finally dispersed into an intricate web-work covering the whole world with no major nodal points.*

**Are self-sustaining cities better? They create more isolationism. They probably create more robustness.

*Knowledge was power-and he was the only man on Earth who knew the origin of the Overlords. How he would use that knowledge he could not guess. It would lie safely in his mind, awaiting the moment of destiny.*

**What would you do if you stumbled on the secret to AGI?

*The average working week was now about twenty hours- but those twenty hours were no sinecure. There was little work left of a routine, mechanical nature. Men's minds were too valuable to waste on tasks that a few thousand transistors, some photoelectric cells, and a cubic metre of printed circuits could perform. There were factories that ran for weeks without being visited by a single human being. Men were needed for trouble-shooting, for making decisions, for planning new enterprises. The robots did the rest.*

**Will a more advanced civilization really bring more leisure?

---
Page: 86

*People could indulge in such whims, because they had both the time and the money. The abolition of armed forces had at once almost doubled the world's effective wealth, and increased production had done the rest. As a result, it was difficult to compare the standard of living of twenty-first-century man with that of any of his predecessors. 
Everything was so cheap that the necessities of life were free, provided as a public service by the community as roads, water, street lighting and drainage had once been. A man could travel anywhere he pleased, eat whatever food he fancied-without handing over any money. He had earned the right to do this by being a productive member of the community.*

**Will this communist utopia work even with true abundance?

Page: 86

*Among all the distractions and diversions of a planet which now seemed well on the way to becoming one vast playground, there were some who still found time to repeat an ancient and never-answered question:
"Where do we go from here?"*

**There will always be dopaminergic people who cannot settle.

*Jan found Professor Sullivan in a small, untidy room that seemed to combine the attributes of office, workshop and laboratory.*

**I think I want similar esthetics for my room.

*Presumably it was a pressure-capsule containing some specimen of deep-sea life, still swimming happily around under its normal tons-to-the-square-centimetre conditions.*

**It's weird how everything doesn't get squashed deep under.

*"Here on this island we're trying to save something of humanity's independence, its artistic traditions. We've no hostility towards the Overlords: we simply want to be left alone to go our own way. When they destroyed the old nations and the way of life man had known since the beginning of history, they swept away many good things with the bad. The world's now placid, featureless and culturally dead: nothing really new has been created since the Overlords came. The reason's obvious. There's nothing left to struggle for, and there are too many distractions and entertainments. Do you realize that every day something like five hundred hours of radio and TV pour out over the various channels? If you went without sleep and did nothing else, you could follow less than a twentieth of the entertainment that's available at the turn of a switch! No wonder that people are becoming passive sponges-absorbing but never creating. Did you know that the average viewing time per person is now three hours a day?*

**3 hours a day is nothing compared to the screen time we have  today.

*It was slightly disturbing, however, to discover that there was a kitchen. In a community of this size, one would normally expect to dial Food Central, wait five minutes, and then get whatever meal they had selected.*

**He predicted foodora.

*Jean wondered how long it was going to take them both to learn to ride. This was yet another unexpected aspect of life on the island. Private cars were not permitted, and indeed were unnecessary, since the greatest distance one could travel in a straight line was less than fifteen kilometres. There were various community-owned service vehicles-trucks, ambulances, and fire-engines, all restricted, except in cases of real emergency, to fifty kilometres an hour. As a result the inhabitants of Athens had plenty of exercise, uncongested streets and no traffic accidents.*

**And here Uber is predicted.

*Even so, the founders' of New Athens could only provide the soil and the climate in which the plant they wished to cherish might-or might not-come to flower. As Salomon himself had remarked: "We can be sure of talent: we can only pray for genius." But it was a reasonable hope that in such a concentrated solution some int~resting reactions would take place. Few artists thrive in solitude, and nothing is more stimulating than the conflict of minds with similar interests.*

**A deep understanding of collective intelligence.

*This was the team working on "total identification". The history of the cinema gave the clue to their actions. First, sound, then colour, then stereoscopy, then Cinerama, had made the old 'moving pictures" more and more like reality itself. Where was the end of the story? Surely, the final stage would be reached when the audience forgot it was an audience, and became part of the action. 
To achieve this would involve stimulation of all the Senses, and perhaps hypnosis as wcll, but many believed it to be practical. When goal was attained, there would be an enormous enrichment of human experience. A man could become-for a while, at least-any other person, and could take part in any conceivable adventure, real or imaginary. 
He could even be plant or animal, if it proved possible to capture and record the sense impressions of other living creatures. And when the "programme" was over, he would have acquired a memory as vivid as any experience in his actual life-indeed, indistinguishable from reality itself.*

**We will get a step closer to this with VR and better 3d cameras.

*The universe was vast, but that fact terrified him less than its mystery. George was not a person who thought deeply on such matters, yet sometimes it seemed to him that men were like children amusing themselves in some secluded playground, protected from the fierce realities of the outer world.*

**We're still just at the shore of the great cosmic ocean, we have not explored anything yet. We are literally living in a bubble.

Page: 121

*Nothing in Athens was done without a committee, that ultimate hall-mark of the democratic method. Indeed, someone had once defined the Colony as a system of interlocking committees. But the system worked, thanks to the patient studies of the social psychologists who had been the real founders of Athens. Because the community was not too large, everyone in it could take some part in its running and could be a citizen in the truest sense of the word.*

**This is the benefit of having small, autonomous cities.

*"It's a great responsibility," Dr. Sen had remarked, "training these young minds ftr the future. Fortunately, human beings are extraordinarily resilient: it takes a pretty bad upbringing to do permanent damage. Even if our aims are mistaken, our little victims will probably get over it. And as you've seen, they appear to be perfectly happy." He paused for a moment, then glanced mischievously up at the towering figure of his passenger. The Inspector was completely clothed in some reflecting silvery cloth so that not an inch of his body was exposed to the fierce sunlight. 
Behind the dark glasses, Dr. Sen was aware of the great eyes watching him emotionlessly-or with emotions which he could never understand. "Our problem in bringing up these children must, I imagine, be very similar to yours when confronted with the human race. Wouldn't you agree?"*

**It's interesting that he considers teaching something damaging, although tongue-in-cheek.

*It might have been Earth. A white sun hung in a blue sky flecked with clouds, which were racing before a storm. A bill sloped gently down to an ocean torn into spray by the ravening wind. Yet nothing moved: the scene was frozen as if glimpsed in a flash of lightning. And far, far away on the horizon was something that was not of Earth-a line of misty columns, tapering slightly as they soared out of the sea and lost themselves among the clouds. They were spaced with perfect precision along the rim of the planet-too huge to be artificial, yet too regular to be natural.
"Sideneus 4 and the Pillars of the Dawn," said Rashaverak, and there was awe in his voice. "He has reached the centre of the Universe."
"And he has barely begun his journey," answered Karellen.)  The planet was absolutely flat. Its enormous gravity had long ago crushed into one uniform level the mountains of its fiery youth-mountains whose mightiest peaks had never exceeded a few metres in height. Yet there was life here, for the surface was covered with a myriad geometrical patterns that crawled and moved and changed their colour. It was a world of two dimensions, inhabited by beings ~who could be no more than a fraction of a centimetre in thickness.*

**How interesting to think about how life would look like in extreme gravity. And what amazing images the boys journey through the universe gives us.

Page: 136

*"But there is one analogy which is-well, suggestive and helpful. It occurs over and over again in your literature. Imagine that every man's mind is an island, surrounded by ocean. Each seems isolated, yet in reality all are linked by the bedrock from which they spring. If the oceans were to vanish, that would be the end of the islands. They would all be part of one continent, but their individuality would have gone.
"Telepathy, as you have called it, is something like this. In suitable circumstances minds can merge and share each other's contents, and carry back memories of the experience when they are isolated once more. In its highest form, this power is not subject to the usual limitations of time and space. That is why Jean could tap the knowledge of her unborn son."*

**We're all just protrusions from the same stuff.

Page: 136

*"Probably, like most men, you have always regarded us as your masters. That is not true. 
We have never been more than guardians, doing a duty imposed upon us from-above.
That duty is hard to define: perhaps you can best think of us as midwives attending a difficult birth. We are helping to bring something new and wonderful into the world."
Rashaverak hesitated: for a moment it almost seemed as if he was at a loss for words.
"Yes, wc are the midwives. But we ourselves are barren."
In that instant, George knew he was in the presence of a tragedy transcending his own. It was incredible-and yet somehow just. Despite all their powers and their brilliance, the Overlords were trapped in some evolutionary cul-de-sac. Here was a great and noble race, in almost every way superior to mankind; yet it had no future, and it was aware of it. In the face of this, George's own problems seemed suddenly trivial.*

**Maybe we will turn out to be barren and we can only watch as AI realizes the dreams of the universe.

*He was changing too, but he still knew them. The boy whose growth they had watched from the formless mists of babyhood was losing his personality, dissolving hour by hour before their very eyes. Yet sometimes he still spoke to them as he had always done, and talked of his toys and friends as if unconscious of what lay ahead. But much of the time he did not see them, or show any awareness of their presence. He no longer slept, as they were forced to do, despite their overwhelming need to waste as few as possible of these last remaining hours.
Unlike Jenny, he seemed to possess no abnormal powers over physical objects-perhaps because, being already partly grown, he had less need for them. His strangeness was entirely in his mental life, of which the dreams were now only a small part. He would stay quite still for hours on end, his eyes tightly closed, as if listening to sounds which no-one else could hear. Into his mind was flooding knowledge-from somewhere or some when which soon would overwhelm and destroy the half-formed creature who had been Jeffrey Angus Greggson.*

**I wonder about the feasibility of acting like an antenna for a greater intelligence. Our physiology clearly has great capacities and were we able to utilize our facilities to perfection we'd be very capable. But still, is there stuff that the performance of our wetware will never be able to achieve?

Page: 138

*It was the end of civilization, the end of all that men had striven for since the beginning of time. In the space of a few days, humanity had lost its future, for the heart of any race is destroyed, and its will to survive is utterly broken, when its children are taken from it.*

**Each child is the leaf in a great lineage of branches, cut the leafs and you have no more growth. 

---
Page: 143

*Lonely? Why had he thought that, wondered George. For that was the one thing they could never be again. Only individuals can be lonely-only human beings. When the barriers were down at last, loneliness would vanish as personality faded. The countless raindrops would have merged into the ocean.*

**The hivemind might be preferable over individuality. 

---
Page: 142

*"For what you have brought into the world may be utterly alien, it may share none of your desires or hopes, it may look upon your greatest achievements as childish toys-yet it is something wonderful, and you will have created it.
"When our race is forgotten, part of yours will still exist. Do not, therefore, condemn us for what we were compelled to do. And remember this-we shall always envy you."*

**It may not come through biology and it may not come through computer science, but some day we might give birth to something more capable and fertile than ourselves. 

---
Page: 142

*"All the earlier changes your race has known took countless ages. But this is a transformation of the mind, not of the body. By the standards of evolution, it will be cataclysmic-instantaneous. It has already begun. You must face this thct: yours is the last generation of Homo sapiens.
"As to the nature of that change, we can tell you very little. We do not know how it is produced-what trigger impulse the Overmind employs when it judges that the time is ripe. All we have discovered is that it starts with a single individual- always a ~child-and then spreads explosively, like the formation of crystals round the first nucleus in a saturated solution. Adults will not be affected, for their minds are already set in an unalterable mould.
"In a few years, it will all be over, and the human race will have divided in twain. There is no way back, and no future for the world you know. All the hopes and dreams of your race are ended now. You have given birth to your successors, and it is your tragedy that you will never understand them-will never even be able to communicate with their minds. Indeed, they will not possess minds as you know them. They will be a single entity, as you yourselves are the sums of your myriad cells. You will not think them human, and you will be right.*

**If there's a hard take off of ai then in geological timescales it will have seemed like a sudden explosion. What's going to supersede it, and how fast will its children take off?

---
Page: 141

*"Again and again we have studied the process we have been sent to foster, hoping that we might learn to escape from our own limitations. But we have glimpsed only the vague outlines of the truth. You called us the Overlords, not knowing the irony of that title. Let us say that above us is the Over-mind, using us as the potter uses his wheel.
"And your race is the clay that is being shaped on that wheel.
"We believe-it is only a theory-that the Overmind Is trying to grow, to extend its powers and its awareness of the universe. By now it must be the sum of many races, and long ago it left the tyranny of matter behind. It is conscious of intelligence, everywhere. 
When it knew that you were almost ready, it sent us here to do its bidding, to prepare you for the transformation that is now at hand.*

**What if AI will turn out to be all powerful but barren? What is the difference between the maker, the tool and what's being created? If we're what's being created, what is the tool that's shaping us and who is our maker? Evolutionary dynamics in an 18 dimensional hypergraph?

*The absence of a single familiar reference point can be utterly unnerving even to the coolest and clearest minds.*

**You have to be comfortable with no footing at all. Like when you're really stoned.

*The Overlords had solved the problem of museum fatigue.
There was no need for anyone to walk.*

**I did not know it was a common thing.

Page: 156

*As for food-well, there was all the fruit and game they required. But now they have left that need behind, like so many others. For food is largely a source of energy, and they have learned to tap greater sources."*

**We could theoretically eat sunlight if our bodies had the knowledge of how to synthesize all necessary building blocks.
