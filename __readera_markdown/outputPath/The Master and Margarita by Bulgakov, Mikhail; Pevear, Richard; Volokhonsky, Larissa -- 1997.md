*Two aphorisms detachable from the novel may suggest something of the complex nature of this freedom and how it may have struck the novel’s first readers. One is the much-quoted ‘Manuscripts don’t burn’, which seems to express an absolute trust in the triumph of poetry, imagination, the free word, over terror and oppression, and could thus become a watchword of the intelligentsia.*

**The immortal idea of the immortality of ideas has been rephrased infinitely many times.

*These circumstances are everywhere present in The Master and Margarita,  which was in part Bulgakov’s challenge to the rule of terror in literature. The successive stages of his work on the novel, his changing evaluations of the nature of the book and its characters, reflect events in his life and his deepening grasp of what was at stake in the struggle.*

**Depth and complexity of content often reflects the authors environment.

*In this version, the original narrator, a characterized ‘chronicler’, is removed. The new narrator is that fluid voice – moving freely from detached observation to ironic double voicing, to the most personal interjection – which is perhaps the finest achievement of Bulgakov’s art.*

**I would like to get a better grip on the tools of narration.

*A more conspicuous case is the Pilate story itself, successive parts of which are told by Woland, dreamed by the poet Homeless, written by the master, and read by Margarita, while the whole preserves its stylistic unity. Narrow notions of the ‘imitation of reality’ break down here.*

**It's impressive to wield language constructs so freely.

*For thousands of years the people have used these festive comic images to express their criticism, their deep distrust of official truth, and their highest hopes and aspirations. Freedom was not so much an exterior right as it was the inner content of these images. It was the thousand-year-old language of fearlessness, a language with no reservations and omissions, about the world and about power.*

**Comedy is the greatest melding with cosmic absurdity.

*‘Yes, man is mortal, but that would be only half the trouble. The worst of it is that he’s sometimes unexpectedly mortal – there’s the trick! And generally he’s unable to say what he’s going to do this same evening.’*

**We solve it by governing as groups of people.
