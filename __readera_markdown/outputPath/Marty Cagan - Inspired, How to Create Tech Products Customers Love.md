*If that’s not bad enough, the second inconvenient truth is that even with the ideas that do prove to have potential, it typ-ically takes several iterations to get the implementation of this idea to the point where it delivers the necessary business value.
We call that time to money.*

**The problem with a road map is that it doesn't have any room for the failure necessary to get to success. 

---
Page: 38

*The f i rst truth is that at least half of our ideas are just not going to work. There are many reasons for an idea to not work out. The most common is that customers just aren’t as excited about this idea as we are.*

**I think our assumption has always been that everyone will like what we give them. Why would they?

---
Page: 39

*Not only is engineering brought in way too late, but the princi-ples and key benef i ts of Agile enter the picture far too late. T eams using Agile in this way are getting maybe 20 percent of the actual value and potential of Agile methods. What you’re really seeing is Agile for delivery, but the rest of the organization and context is anything but Agile.*

**What does an end to end agile company look like?

---
Page: 43

*Products are def i ned and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially. They have f i nally moved beyond the old model in which a product manager def i nes requirements, a designer designs a solution that delivers on those requirements, and then engineering implements those requirements, with each person living with the constraints and decisions of the ones that preceded.
In strong teams, product, design, and engineering work side by side, in a give-and-take way, to come up with technology-powered solutions that our customers love and that work for our business.*

**Who should be included when and where? It's easy to have to few and too many in different stages of an iteration. 

---
Page: 43

*Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end. In modern teams, we tackle these risks prior to deciding to build anything.
These risks include value risk (whether customers will buy it), usability risk (whether users can f i gure out how to use it), feasi-bility risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills, and technology we have), and business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business—sales, marketing, f i nance, legal, etc.).*

**I guess these risk assessments are iterative. 

---
Page: 43

*Finally, it’s all about solving problems, not implementing features. Conventional product roadmaps are all about output.
Strong teams know it’s not only about implementing a solution.
They must ensure that solution solves the underlying problem.
It’s about business results.*

**If we start with a goal it'll be easier to know if we're getting the desired outcome.

---
Page: 44

*This certainly includes the functionality—the features.
But it also includes the technology that enables this functionality.
It also includes the user experience design that presents this functionality.
And it includes how we monetize this functionality.
It includes how we attract and acquire users and customers.
And it can also include off l ine experiences as well that are essential to delivering the product’s value.*

**The concept of product is meant to tie different aspects together that makes sense.

---
Page: 46

*Discovery is very much about the intense collaboration of product management, user experience design, and engineering. In discovery, we are tackling the various risks before we write even one line of production software.
The purpose of product discovery is to quickly separate the good ideas from the bad. The output of product discovery is a validated product backlog.
Specif i cally, this means getting answers to four critical questions:
1. Will the user buy this (or choose to use it)?
2. Can the user f i gure out how to use this?
3. Can our engineers build this?
4. Can our stakeholders support this?*

**We're definitely not doing this continuously, collaboratively or focused enough. The research is all over the place. Engineers are not involved until the last step.

---
Page: 47

*T osetyourexpectations, strong teams normally test many product ideas each week—on the order of 10 to 20 or more per week.*

**How many ideas are we testing? I think I've argued for myself that we need to reach a base level and iterate from there. But how do we know what that base level actually is and when we've reached it.

*product/market f i t.
This is the smallest possible actual product that meets the needs of a specif i c market of customers.*

**What are the activities involved in assessing if you have product/market fit?

Page: 49

*They have spent literally months building an MVP when they could have had this same learning in days or, sometimes, even in hours.
The other unhappy consequence is that very often the rest of the company—especially key leadership in sales and marketing—is confused and embarrassed by what the product team is trying to get customers to buy and use.
While this is partly a result of the way most people have learned this concept, I think the root of the issue is that while the P in MVP stands for product, an MVP should never be an actual product (where product is def i ned as something that your developers can release with conf i dence, that your customers can run their business on, and that you can sell and support).
The MVP should be a prototype, not a product.
Building an actual product-quality deliverable to learn, even if that deliverable has minimal functionality, leads to substantial waste of time and money, which of course is the antithesis of Lean.*

**We should stop doing product discovery in our product. We should focus more on prototyping. If engineers are blocked while discovery is in progress they can always improve the platform, and they can also help out with discovery.

*Mercenaries build whatever they’re told to build. Missionaries are true believers in the vision and are committed to solving problems for We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries.
their customers. In a dedicated product team, the team acts and feels a lot like a startup within the larger company, and that’s very much the intention.*

**We're definitely treating our team as mercenaries. We'd have to let go of decision-making way more if we want them to become missionaries. What decisions are we reluctant to delegate and why? If X would make decision Y I would feel Z.

---
Page: 56

*There are lots of useful ways to slice up the pie. Sometimes we have each team focus on a different type of user or customer. Some-times each team is responsible for a different type of device. Sometimes we break things up by workf l ow or customer journey.
Sometimes, actually very often, we are largely def i ning the teams based on the architecture. This is pretty common because the architec-ture drives the technology stack, which often requires different types of engineering expertise.
In any case, what’s critically important is alignment between prod-uct management and engineering. This is why the head of product and the head of engineering normally get together to def i ne the size and scope of the teams.
I will tell you there’s never a perfect way to carve up the pie. Real-ize that, when you optimize for one thing, it comes at the expense of something else. So, decide what’s most important to you and go with that.*

**When the time comes for scaling engineering can't be alone in deciding how to split things. We need it to work end to end. 

---
Page: 53

*They are given clear objectives, and they own delivering on those objectives.
They are empowered to f i gure out the best way to meet those objectives, and they are accountable for the results.*

**How does one set good objectives? Should the objectives themselves be iterated on? How does one hold a team accountable? Is it about firing people?

---
Page: 57

*Obviously, this doesn’t mean they can go off and work on whatever looks fun, but it does mean that they are able to try to solve the problems they are assigned in the best way they see f i t.*

**What tools and authority does the team need to succeed in this? How does one intervene without stealing ownership? 

---
Page: 72

*In the old model, designers took requirements or specif i cations from product managers and used that to create their designs. In contrast, modern product designers continuously collaborate with product man-agers and engineers—from discovery to delivery. Similarly, rather than sitting with fellow designers, the modern product designer sits side by 53 54 INSPIRED side with his or her product manager, a full partner with the product manager on product discovery.*

**Do our designers have the chops to drive product discovery? If not how do we get them there? If they do, how do we empower them to make use of it?

---
Page: 73

*Good product designers think about the customer’s journey over time as they interact with the product and with the company as a whole.*

**Is this something that our designers are doing? If not then why not?

---
Page: 74

*Good product designers are constantly testing their ideas with real users and customers. They don’t just test when a prototype or idea is ready; they build testing into their weekly cadence, so they’re able to constantly validate and ref i ne ideas as well as collect new insights they might not have been looking for.*

**How often does our designers talk to customers? Is it weekly?

---
Page: 74

*User testing is broader than usability testing. Product designers and their product teams utilize the opportunity to assess the value of their ideas. Will customers use or buy the product and, if not, why not?*

**When we start developing we should already have a decent idea of this?

---
Page: 75

*This is particularly important in mobile interfaces in which designers must often create new models of interaction fundamentally intertwined with the visual design.*

**We're lacking quite heavily in interaction design. Animations, sounds, transitions and so on are not included in our designs.

---
Page: 77

*Encourage your designer to iterate early and often. The best way you can encourage this is to not get all nitpicky about design details with the very early iterations. More generally, encourage your designer to feel free not to just iterate on the particular design approach but to explore alternative solutions to the problem.*

**Nit-picking is something I have had to work with. You have to be ok with people doing things in a way you wouldn't have. 

---
Page: 79

*It’s also critical that you share very openly what you know about your customers—especially their pain—the data, and your busi-ness constraints. Your job is to bring this information to your team and then to discuss the various potential solutions to these problems.*

**We've tried different ways to include engineers in the ideation phase but it hasn't worked really well. There's been a lack of engagement. Why is that? Not everyone will want to get involved and that's fine, but at least some need to be engaged. 

---
Page: 80

*One last thing to keep in mind: the morale of the engineers is very much a function of you as the product manager. It is your job to make sure they feel like missionaries and not mercenaries. You do this by involving them deeply in the customer pain you are trying to solve and in the business problems you face. Don’t try to shelter them from this—instead, share these problems and challenges very openly with them. They will respect you more for it, and, in most cases, the developers will rise to the challenge.*

**We could definitely include engineers more and be more transparent with them.

---
Page: 83

*Modernproductmarketing managers represent the market to the product team—the position-ing, the messaging, and a winning go-to-market plan. They are deeply engaged with the sales channel and know their capabilities, limitations, and current competitive issues.*

**Are we getting this systematically from marketing? Not really.

---
Page: 83

*If your company sells directly to consumers, it becomes easy for the marketing teams to focus on clicks and brand at the expense of ensuring all the product work adds up to a successfully differentiated market position. This is important to the long-term prospects of any company but also brings more meaning into all the work the product team does.*

**Marketing needs have their antennas tuned to the market and the users, the way they engage with the product and other similar products. They are a big part of product discovery and finding product market fit.

---
Page: 87

*The key to tapping into the real value that these user researchers can provide is to keep in mind that the learning must be shared learn-ing. You need to witness the insights f i rst hand. More on this when we talk about the principles of product discovery, but while I want you to appreciate what user research can help you with, I don’t want you to think you can delegate to them to do the learning and then send you a report.*

**Reports are so hard to grok and empathize with. You get so much more from being there live.

---
Page: 97

*Some companies think the answer to this is to try to document the system to the degree that everything is captured somehow in a way that members of the organization can all go to get the same sorts of answers for which they use the principal designer, principal product manager, and software architect.
I know a few organizations that have tried hard to achieve this, but I have never seen this succeed. The systems always seem to grow in complexity and size much faster than anyone can document, and with software, the def i nitive answer always lives in the source code itself (at least the current answer—not usually the rationale or the history).*

**Reading the documentation is not the same thing as learning something by experiencing it.

---
Page: 102

*They understand that they need to make mistakes in order to learn, but they need to make them quickly and mitigate the risks. They understand the need for continuous innovation. They know that great products are the result of true collaboration. They respect and value their designers and engineers. They understand the power of a motivated product team.*

**We're far from having everybody on the same page. 

---
Page: 113

*The point here is that you need to have an investment strategy, and your team structure should be a ref l ection of that.*

**What's our investment strategy? I guess it becomes more relevant the more mature you are as a company.

---
Page: 114

*As organizations grow, we often f i nd common needs and the increased importance of shared services. We do this for speed and reliability. We don’t want every team reinventing the wheel. Realize, however, that creating shared services also creates dependencies and can impinge on autonomy.*

**I would like to try picking some members from each team and having them be in-charge of keeping the platform aligned. Though Conway's law might turn this into a dependency nightmare. 

---
Page: 115

*However, it is also a diff i cult type of team to staff because these teams are dependencies (by design) of all the other teams, as they are there to enable the other teams.
Be sure to staff these common services teams with strong and highly technical product managers (often called platform product managers).*

**I never even thought about having a product manager for our platform team. But it's obvious when you think about. How else are we going to discover what a good platform is? The users are internal but they still need to be interacted with as users.

---
Page: 116

*Realize that the optimal structure of the product organiza-tion is a moving target. The organization’s needs should and will change over time. It’s not like you’ll need to reorganize every few months, but reviewing your team structure every year or so makes sense.*

**Nice, practical advice. 

---
Page: 117

*Whenever this happens, I try to get to the specif i cs of just what it is that the team is not able to decide or where they feel constrained.
Most of what I hear falls into one of two cases:
1. In the f i rst case, the team simply isn’t trusted yet by manage-ment, and management is reluctant to give too long of a rope to the team.
2. In the second case, the team wants to change something that the leaders had assumed was part of the foundation.
In general, most teams would probably agree that there are some things that are wide open for the team to do as they think best and other areas that are part of the common foundation that all teams share.
As an example of the latter, it would be unusual for each team to select its own software conf i guration management tool. If the engineering team has standardized on GitHub, then that is usually considered part of the foundation. Even if one team had a strong preference for a different tool, the total cost to the organization of allowing its use would likely far outweigh any benef i ts.*

**It's a balancing act between individuality of the teams and alignment as a group. We could pretty easily define and agree on what the teams have full autonomy over and what things we need to agree on together. Clarity is more important than details. 

---
Page: 120

*Another factor is the level of accountability that goes along with the empowerment and autonomy. If there’s no accountability—and espe-cially if you don’t have strong A teams—there’s little reason for the teams to stress about these tradeoffs. But you want the teams to stress over these tradeoffs. If I believe the team is strong and they fully understand the consequences and risks, and yet they still feel they need to replace a key component of the foundation, then I tend to side with that team.*

**The consequence of not siding with the team is that you're stripping them of ownership and accountability since you made the decision for them.

---
Page: 121

*If you f i nd that teams are consistently making poor decisions in this regard, you may need to consider the experience level of the people on the team, but most likely, the teams are missing the full business context.
The critical context is comprised of two things:
1. The overall product vision 2. The specif i c business objectives assigned to each team*

**What's the overall product vision? What are the business objectives assigned to each team? Right now we have two teams that do the same thing but in two clients.

---
Page: 131

*It’s worth pointing out that it isn’t the list of ideas on the roadmap that’s the problem. If it was just ideas, there’s not much harm in that.
The issue is that anytime you put a list of ideas on a document entitled The Problems with Product Roadmaps 113 “roadmap,” no matter how many disclaimers you put on it, people across the company will interpret the items as a commitment. And that’s the crux of the problem, because now you’re committed to build-ing and delivering this thing, even when it doesn’t solve the underlying problem.*

**We've had this for sure, we do point out that it's preliminary and that things can change but people are still glued to what's on the roadmap. 

---
Page: 139

*Again, in good companies these types of commitments are min-imized, but there are always some. It’s important for the organization to get comfortable with making these high-integrity commitments and explain to the company that, while they are not something we do frequently, when we do them, they can depend on the product team delivering on these commitments.*

**With a common language for this we will be able to set expectations amongst ourselves better. How much time should be allowed for discovery to find out timelines?

---
Page: 143

*You can do some amount of testing of the vision, but it’s not the same as the testing of specif i c solutions we do in product discovery.
In truth, buying into a vision is always a bit of a leap of faith. You likely don’t know how, or even if, you’ll be able to deliver on the vision. But remember you have several years to discover the solutions. At this stage, you should believe it’s a worthwhile pursuit.*

**The vision comes from the heart, not the brain. It's what gives us purpose.

---
Page: 144

*So, all teams know we’re tackling the manufacturing market now, and that’s the type of customers we are obsessing on. Our goal is to come up with the smallest actual deliverable product that makes these manufacturing customers successful. Ideas that come up that pertain to other types of customers or markets are saved for future consideration.*

**Imagine how it would look like when the entire team is obsessed. They would be egging on each other to understand the problem and the customer more and more. Curiosity turned into a laser. 

---
Page: 145

*For a product team to be empowered and act with any mean-ingful degree of autonomy, the team must have a deep understanding of the broader context. This starts with a clear and compelling product vision, and the path to achieving that vision is the product strategy.
The more product teams you have, the more essential it is to have this unifying vision and strategy for each team to be able to make good choices.*

**Leadership should be obsessed with empowering their teams as it's the best shot at solving their business problems. Continuously provide business context. Should it be distilled? Is there such a thing as too much information?

---
Page: 145

*The difference between vision and strategy is analogous to the dif-ference between good leadership and good management. Leadership inspires and sets the direction, and management helps get us there.
Most important, the product vision should be inspiring, and the product strategy should be focused.*

**When and how do you shift focus? It's usually a gradual shift. But in that shift, confusion seeps in. 

---
Page: 148

*Fall in love with the problem, not with the solution.*

**Crypto is painful to use in your everyday life.

---
Page: 148

*Start with why*

**A world running on crypto will be more transparent, faster to correct and better suited to integrate with everything digital. If we want a digital world, we need a digitally native form of money. 

---
Page: 149

*Determine and embrace relevant and meaningful trends.*

**AI is here and I expect that most products will have integrated it in some way, shape or form within the next two years or so. 

---
Page: 149

*This is usually called a vision pivot, but mostly it’s a sign of a weak product organization. It is never easy, so prepare yourself for that. But, also be careful you don’t get attached to details. It is very possible that you may have to adjust course to reach your desired destination. That’s called a discovery pivot, and there’s nothing wrong with that.*

**Discovery pivot is what we're going to coach everyone to be able to do. 

---
Page: 152

*Focus on one target market or persona at a time.*

**Should we get Europe done before we start with Seychelles?

---
Page: 152

*The vision is meant to inspire the organization, but the organi-zation ultimately is there to come up with solutions that deliver on the business strategy. So, for example, if that business strat-egy involves a change in monetization strategy or business model, then the product strategy needs to be aligned with this.*

**What is our business strategy? A lot of companies have very simple strategies, like "widest possible reach through broadcast, latest technology used, etc.".

---
Page: 155

*Whether you choose to go public with your principles depends on your purpose. In many cases, the principles are simply a tool for the product teams. But, in other cases, the principles serve as a clear statement of what you believe—intended for your users, customers, partners, suppliers, investors, and your employees.*

**Product principles is a great control mechanism. If you want the flavor of the teams' solutions to be a certain way, then principles are useful and not to invasive on their autonomy. 

---
Page: 157

*The f i rst principle is fundamentally about how to empower and motivate people to get them to do their best work, and the second is about how to meaningfully measure progress.*

**Empower and measure instead of control. Empowering is scary because you need to let go of control, but that's where measurement let's you have a little bit of control. 

---
Page: 157

*While the concept of team objectives might sound straightfor-ward, there are many ways to institutionalize this across product teams and organizations, and it can take a few quarters before the organization f i nds its groove.*

**Is the myth of the objective going to be a problem? 

**How long will it take for us to permeate the change? We should start by acting, and let the mindset follow.

---
Page: 159

*Find a good cadence for your organization (typically, annually for an organization’s objectives and quarterly for a team’s objectives).*

**Is this agile enough? How do we set good objectives? What do we do if we don't reach them?

---
Page: 160

*Be very transparent (across the product and technology organi-zation) on what objectives each product team is working on and their current progress.*

**I would like us to work in the open. Somehow have a place where everybody can track each other's progress and ideas. A huge Figma board might do it.

---
Page: 160

*The individual product teams are responsible for proposing the key results for each objective they’ve been assigned. It is normal to have a give-and-take process each quarter as the OKRs are f i nalized for each team and for the organization.*

**What kind of process should you have for this? Whatever it is, it's going to involve a bunch of meetings. 

---
Page: 164

*Focus the attention of the individuals on their product team objectives. If different functional organizations (such as design, engineering, or quality assurance) have larger objectives (such as responsive design, technical debt, and test automation), they should be discussed and prioritized at the leadership team level along with the other business objectives, and then incorporated into the relevant product team’s objectives.*

**How do we squeeze in the DORA metrics there? I like the fact of aligning them with the business. Though I think the support concept will allow us to naturally and regularly keep technical debt manageable. 

---
Page: 163

*The OKRs also help to ensure that each team is aligned with the objectives of the company.
Moreover, as an organization scales, OKRs become an increas-ingly necessary tool for ensuring that each product team understands how they are contributing to the greater whole, coordinating work across teams, and avoiding duplicate work.*

**What's the process for setting the OKRs? I'm afraid that it would be a backdoor into the top-down mindset we have right now. 

---
Page: 166

*With startups or small organizations, when everyone essentially knows what everyone else is doing and why, it’s normal for each product team to propose their objectives and key results. There’s some amount of give and take, and then people get to work. With larger organizations, product teams need more help.*

**I really like the idea of the teams setting the OKRs. It puts the onus on the people who are the best suited to figure out reasonable objectives. What management can do is challenge them and coach them so they can reach greater heights. We can also support them with as much clarity concerning the business context as possible. Again I'm worried that micromanagement might slip through.

---
Page: 167

*These platform teams will get requests from most or even all the higher-level product teams, and they are there to help them succeed. But, again, leadership will need to help coordinate the objectives for these teams and make sure we coordinate the dependencies and align the interests.*

**Couldn't this be done simply through focusing on their immediate customers? If they find a way to best serve the other teams then that should cascade through to the customers of the company.

---
Page: 171

*Do your homework. Your team and your stakeholders will all be much more likely to follow you if they believe you know what you’re talking about. Be the undisputed expert on your users and customers. And be the undisputed expert on your market, including your competitors and the relevant trends.*

**We don't have an expert on any user or any market. 

---
Page: 172

*Spend time with your team. If you’re not spending signif i cant face time with your designer and every engineer on your team, then they can’t see the enthusiasm in your eyes. If your team is not co-located, you’ll need to make a special effort to travel there and do this at least every couple months. Spending some personal time with every last person on the team pays off big in their level of motivation and, as a result, in the velocity of the team. It’s worth your time.*

**The executive team can share this burden. We can spread out to different locations and help inspire at each location. Long-term we should start to narrow down the locations we support.

---
Page: 178

*I mostly emphasize discovery techniques, as our focus is on product managers, and that is their primary responsibility.
The bulk of the product manager’s time needs to be focused on working with her product team, with her key stakeholders, and with her customers to discover solutions that her customers love and that work for the business.*

**We should designate a product manager per team. Who is the  most suited for it? 

---
Page: 181

*I always try hard to reserve the term product to describe the state at which we can run a business on it. Specif i cally, it is scalable and performant to the degree necessary. It has a strong suite of automated regression tests. It is instrumented to collect the necessary analytics.
It has been internationalized and localized where appropriate. It is maintainable. It is consistent with the brand promise. And, most important, it is something the team can release with conf i dence.*

**This is the only thing we're doing at the moment.

---
Page: 182

*If you are an early stage startup and you have no customers, then of course this is not really an issue (and it’s very likely premature to even be creating production-quality software).*

**We were never allowed to have this. Our project got hyped beyond imagination and we completely overpromised.

---
Page: 182

*But here’s the key. If you want to discover great products, it really is essential that you get your ideas in front of real users and customers early and often.
If you want to deliver great products, you want to use best practices for engineering and try not to override the engineers’ concerns.*

**How do we intertwine these two activities?

---
Page: 186

*“The most important thing is to know what you can’t know,” and we can’t know in advance which of our ideas will work with customers and which won’t.
So, we approach discovery with the mindset that many, if not most, of our ideas won’t work out. The most common reason for this is value, but sometimes the design is too complicated, and sometimes it would take far too long to build, and sometimes there turn out to be legal or privacy issues. The point is we need to be open to solving the underlying problem in different ways if necessary.*

**We rarely dig into the value part. We only focus on usability. 

---
Page: 187

*If the f i rst time your developers see an idea is at sprint planning, you have failed. We need to ensure the feasibility before we decide to build, not after. Not only does this end up saving a lot of wasted time, but it turns out that getting the engineer’s perspective earlier also tends to improve the solution itself, and it’s critical for shared learning.*

**We should involve, at least the team leads from day one. The only possible drawback is that they'd be part of many irrelevant discussions. 

---
Page: 187

*One of the keys to having a team of missionaries rather than a team of mercenaries is that the team has learned together.
They have seen the customer’s pain together, they have watched together as some ideas failed and others worked, and they all understand the context for why this is important and what needs to be done.*

**We want everyone to be able to empathize with the customers and their problems. That will allow everybody to make each decision, no matter how small, with the customer in mind. Value is so hard to generate that this is necessary. 

---
Page: 189

*We loosely def i ne an iteration in discovery as trying out at least one new idea or approach. It’s true that ideas come in all shapes and sizes, and some are much riskier than others, but the purpose of discovery is to do this much faster and cheaper than we can do in delivery.
T o set your expectations, teams competent in modern discovery techniques can generally test on the order of 10–20 iterations per week.*

**This here should be our goal. How do we achieve this? We should also start weaving in a small portion of the engineers' time here. It would also be awesome with continuous updates about the discovery results. We could have a stand up where this is discussed. Do we have enough people? 

---
Page: 189

*As a rule of thumb, an iteration in discovery should be at least an order of magnitude less time and effort than an iteration in delivery.*

**So if something takes one month to deliver, it should take three days to validate. Should we rethink our expectations of delivery timelines? At least I think we should be more serious about the phased rollout to production. It should be easy for us to engage with and send updates to our beta testers. 

---
Page: 193

*So, as you can see, we need quite a range of techniques. Some of the techniques are quantitative, and some are qualitative. Some of the techniques are designed to collect proof (or at least statistically signif i -cant results), and some are designed to collect evidence. All are designed to help us learn quickly.*

**We have Framing, Planning, Ideation, Prototyping, Testing of feasibility, usability, value and business viability. All of this should be possible to do in days, not weeks.

*We must also consider value risk—do the customers want this par-ticular problem solved and is our proposed solution good enough to get people to switch from what they have now?*

**I pose this question all the time. This book gives me more confidence to be more adamant about it. And now I will know better how to get an answer to the question. 

---
Page: 195

*And then there’s the often-messy business risk, where we have to make sure that the solution we come up with in discovery works for the different parts of our company. Here are some common examples of that*

**We could literally create a checklist with all risk questions we need an answer to and then hold each other to it. We could use it to navigate our work. 

---
Page: 195

*If the product manager, designer, and tech lead do not feel there’s a signif i cant risk in any of these areas, then normally we would just proceed to delivery—fully realizing there’s a chance the team will occasionally be proved wrong. This, however, is preferable to the Discovery Framing Techniques 177 alternative of having the team be extremely conservative and test every assumption.
We like to use our discovery time and validation techniques for those situations in which we know there’s a signif i cant risk, or where members of the team disagree.*

**Let's make this a principle somehow, so we don't get stuck on requesting research for everything. 

---
Page: 197

*But one of the most important lessons in our industry is to fall in love with the problem, not the solution.
Why is this so important? Because, more often than not, our initial solutions don’t solve the problem—at least not in a way that can power a successful business. It usually takes trying out several different approaches to a solution before we f i nd one that solves the underlying problem.*

**We need to be more vocal about the problem, we need to develop our language around it so that we can think more deeply.

**The problem is very fuzzy and implicit at the moment. There's no reason why we can't be very explicit about it. That makes it easier for people to question it and more importantly question the solutions to it. 

---
Page: 197

*This is another reason why typical product roadmaps are so problematic.*

**Could we replace the public roadmap with our sprint plans instead? Or we can make our beta test periods longer, and after a week in beta we put up that it's coming in two weeks or something? We'll get a good grasp of how long stuff takes in beta after a few tries.

*Some people also consider this a demand-validation technique (if you can’t get your team excited, maybe it’s not worth doing). It’s only validating demand or value with your colleagues rather than with real customers, however, so I think of it primarily as a framing technique.*

**Would it be useful to validate it with external people as well?

---
Page: 206

*In this situation, you have a much broader set of risks, including validating your value proposition, f i guring out how you intend to make money, how you plan to get this product out to your customers and sell to them, how much it will cost to produce and sell this product, and what you will measure to track your progress—not to mention determining whether the market is large enough to sustain a business.*

**I could have several GPT agents helping out with these questions. 

---
Page: 209

*Rather than delegating or deferring f i guring out the solution, we need to embrace product discovery as the most important core competency of the startup.*

**Does our product team have the chops for being world class at product discovery? Or do we need to beef it up?

---
Page: 209

*The point is that you don’t need to spend your time doing pric-ing optimization testing, sales tools, marketing programs, and cutting costs, until and unless you have discovered a truly valuable product.*

**How do we get to a valuable product as fast as possible?

---
Page: 217

*The concept behind this technique is to focus on developing this set of reference customers for a specif i c target market, which then makes it easy for sales to go after those specif i c types of customers.
Once we have those reference customers for that initial target market, we can move on to expanding the product to meet the needs of the next target market.*

**Would our CAC be lower if we tailored our marketing messages to specific target markets that we know are more interested? 

---
Page: 218

*We are looking for prospective customers that truly feel the pain and are near desperate for the solution we want to build. If they could f i nd a solution that worked for them elsewhere, they would have already bought it.
However, it’s also important we screen out technologists. These people are mainly interested because of the technology, not because they desperately need the business value.*

**I think our exclusive community might be too much of technologists. 

**What would our reference customers say about us and the product? 

**How big is the TAM of KASTA token holders?

---
Page: 221

*we instead focus on a somewhat larger number of consumers (on the order of 10–50) that we engage with to get them to the point that they are loving our product.*

**Does our exclusive community love our product? Why? Why not?

---
Page: 225

*The team quickly learned that, while it may be a worthwhile objective to get to a common code base, it’s an empty victory if the product that results is not good. Moreover, users choose their devices and platforms because they value what’s different, not what’s the same. From the customer’s point of view, they would rather wait a little longer and have a better platform-specif i c solution, than simultaneously ship a generic product on all platforms.*

**I wonder if the cross-platform nature of the PWA is actually going to be a weakness?

---
Page: 227

*Remarkably, in the vast majority of companies (not the ones that are good at product), the actual product teams don’t do much ideation themselves. This is because what’s really going on is that the ideas are already handed to the product teams in the form of prioritized features on product roadmaps, where most of the items on those roadmaps are coming either from requests from big customers (or prospective customers), or from company stakeholders or execs.
Unfortunately, these are rarely the quality of ideas we’re looking for.*

**We need to explicitly stop doing this. It will be a journey to make it work well and I think we'll need to coach each other along the way. 

---
Page: 231

*Frequency. Establish a regular cadence of customer interviews. This should not be a once-in-a-while thing. A bare minimum would be two to three hours of customer interviews per week, every week.*

**We're doing this maybe every month. And we're definitely not including key people every time.

---
Page: 231

*Recruiting users and customers. I talk much more about this when we discuss the usability testing technique, but for now, be sure to talk primarily to people in your intended target market.
You’re looking for about an hour of their time.*

**We should go outside our exclusive community. We should also be very specific about our target market. 

---
Page: 232

*Who should attend. My favorite is to bring three people to these interviews: the product manager, the product designer, and one of the engineers from the team (we normally rotate among those that want to attend). Usually, the designer drives (because they’ve usually been trained how to do this well), the product manager takes notes, and the developer observes.*

**Let's make it very clear when the interviews are happening and let the teams self-organize. We should encourage a certain level of communication. 

---
Page: 232

*I would argue that this hour consistently yields a great return on your time.*

**How much do we need to streamline in order to make the interview cadence feasible for our organization? What can we do to make it more efficient? Do we need more people?

*A concierge test requires going out to the actual users and customers and asking them to show you how they work so that you can learn how to do their job, and so that you can work on providing them a much better solution.*

**You're literally putting yourself in the customer's shoes. Is this possible to do well remotely?

*From its earliest days, eBay has always had an “Everything Else” category. This is where people could buy and sell things that we at eBay couldn’t anticipate people might want to trade. And while we antici-pated a lot (there were and still are thousands of categories), some of the biggest innovations and bigges*

**Can we do anything to make our product more customizable by the customer? Can we open up the sandbox a little bit and see where they want to go? An API is one way of doing it, although it's a really big undertaking and you're creating a very risky coupling. 

---
Page: 241

*There are two major benef i ts to these directed hack days. The f i rst is practical, as the technique facilitates the inclusion of engineers at ideation. I’ve mentioned several times in this book that many of the best ideas come from the engineers on the team, and we need to ensure this is happening. It should be happening on an ongoing basis, but this technique will ensure it happens.
The second benef i t is cultural. This is one of my favorite tech-niques for building a team of missionaries rather than mercenaries. The engineers, if they haven’t already, are now diving much deeper into the business context and playing a much larger role in terms of innovation.*

**It's also a very good way to give people permission to participate. People can be really uncomfortable going outside of what they think their role and responsibility is.

---
Page: 243

*This typically means two things. First, we need the prototype to access our live data sources, and second, we need to be able to send live traff i c—in enough quantity to get some useful data—to the prototype.*

**How would we do this? Proxy production traffic? 

---
Page: 247

*The overarching purpose of any form of prototype is to learn something at a much lower cost in terms of time and effort than building out a product.*

**Learn quickly, explore solutions more deeply, develop a shared understanding, use appropriate type and fidelity and use as a spec for development. 

---
Page: 249

*Further, most of the time the feasibility prototype is intended to be throwaway code—it’s okay and normal to be quick and dirty with this. It is intended to be just enough to collect the data, for example, to show that performance would likely be acceptable or not. There is usually no user interface, error handling, or any of the typical work involved in productization.
In my experience, building a feasibility prototype requires usually just a day or two of time. If you’re exploring a major new technology, such as a new approach leveraging machine-learning tech-nology, then the feasibility prototype could very well take signif i cantly longer.*

**We don't have this as part of our practices at the moment. But I bet developers would really enjoy getting to do less high stakes experimentation. 

---
Page: 253

*Where a lot of novice product people go sideways is when they create a high-f i delity user prototype and they put it in front of 10 or 15 people who all say how much they love it. They think they’ve validated their product, but unfortunately, that’s not how it works.
People say all kinds of things and then go do something different.
We have much better techniques for validating value, so it’s important that you understand what a user prototype is not appropriate for.*

**This is why the value we're trying to create is so fuzzy at the moment. 

---
Page: 256

*What’s important is that actual users will use the live-data proto-type for real work, and this will generate real data (analytics) that we can compare to our current product—or to our expectations—to see if this new approach performs better.*

**Should one inform customers that they're part of this test?

**What specific tools are there for doing something like this?

---
Page: 259

*These types of hybrids are great examples of the build things that don’t scale philosophy of product discovery. By being a little clever, we can quickly and easily create tools that let us learn very quickly. Admit-tedly, it’s mainly qualitative learning, but that’s often where our biggest insights come from anyway.*

**We need a more experimental and iterative mindset. We need a clear separation about what it means to learn and what it means to polish.

---
Page: 260

*Remember that for many of the things we work on, most or all of these questions are very straightforward and low risk. Your team is conf i dent. They have been there and done this many times before, and so we will proceed to delivery.*

**Doing this as an exercise for every little thing could make us numb to it. If we automate into the process once we've gotten a feel for it, we may be able to apply it more efficiently. 

---
Page: 263

*No, you won’t be as prof i cient as a trained user researcher—at least at f i rst—and it’ll take you a few sessions to get the hang of it, but, in most cases, you’ll f i nd that you can still identify the serious issues and friction points with your product, which is what’s important.*

**Can we have Barbara coach some people into being able to run user research on their own? 

---
Page: 264

*Good prod-uct managers know they will get the product wrong initially and that nobody gets it right the f i rst time. They know that learning from these tests is the fastest path to a successful product.*

**The first iteration of anything is more about putting a stake in the ground, somewhere to start the process from.

---
Page: 265

*There are tools for doing this type of testing remotely, and I encourage that, but they are primarily designed for usability testing and not for the value testing that will usually follow. So, I view the remote usability testing as a supplement rather than a replacement.*

**This may be one of the reasons why we've managed to avoid doing value testing. 

---
Page: 266

*When you f i rst start the actual usability test, make sure to tell your subject that this is just a prototype, it’s a very early product idea, and it’s not real. Explain that she won’t be hurting your feelings by giving her candid feedback, good or bad. You’re testing the ideas in the prototype, you’re not testing her. She can’t pass or fail—only the prototype can pass or fail.*

**We could use the product that we have and say that it's a high fidelity prototype. 

---
Page: 268

*But forget big reports that take a long time to write, are sel-dom read, and are obsolete by the time they’re delivered because the prototype has already progressed so far beyond what was used when the tests were done. They really aren’t worth anyone’s time.*

**Our research reports are enormous. We can probably reduce them by in size and quality by 80% and get roughly the same value.

---
Page: 270

*The customer must perceive your product to be substantially better to motivate them to buy your product and then wade through the pain and obstacles of migrating from their old solution.*

**Different products and different customers have different perceived switching cost. Compete on the dimension where you have the best shot.

---
Page: 271

*For many products, we need to test eff i cacy, which refers to how well this solution solves the underlying problem. In some types of products, this is very objective and quantitative. For example, in advertising tech-nology, we can measure the revenue generated and easily compare that to other advertising technology alternatives. In other types of products, such as games, it’s much less objective.*

**I don't think that we're competitive on any quantitative metrics. Our fees are higher, our KYC is stricter.  

---
Page: 273

*What’s critical for this to be effective is that the users not have any visible indication that this is a test until after they click that button. The benef i t is that we can quickly collect some very helpful data that will allow us to compare the click-through rate on this button with our expectations or with other features. And then we can follow up with customers to get a better understanding of what they would expect.
The same basic concept applies to entire products. Rather than a button on a page, we set up the landing page for the new offering’s product funnel. This is called a landing page demand test. We describe that new offering exactly as we would if we were really launching the service. The difference is that if the user clicks the call to action, rather than signing up for the trial (or whatever the action might be), the user sees a page that explains that you are studying the possibility of adding this new offering, and you’d like to talk with them about that new offering if they’re willing.*

**Demand hasn't been an issue for us. We kind of did this with our token launch. But a crypto bull market is irrational.

Page: 274

*One of the real advantages to startups from a product point of view is that there’s no legacy to drag along, no revenue to preserve, and no reputation to safeguard. This allows us to move very quickly and take signif i cant risks without much downside.*

**We have an insignificant amount of revenue, can we still be bold?

---
Page: 280

*One technique I like for gauging value is to see if the user would be willing to pay for it, even if you have no intention of charging them for it. We’re looking for the user to pull out his or her credit card right then and there and ask to buy the product (but we don’t really want the card information).*

**People start thinking more critically when money is involved, however if you can't sell the product to an enthusiastic early adopter then you can't sell it to anyone else.

---
Page: 285

*Keep in mind that this is a slightly different type of A/B test than optimization A/B testing. Optimization testing is where we experiment with different calls to action, different color treatments on a button, and so forth. Conceptually they are the same, but in practice there are some differences. Optimization testing is normally surface-level, low-risk changes, which we often test in a split test (50:50).*

**This kind of AB test is way safer, could we use our groomed beta testers for this? Maybe it's actually much better to target users that are unaware that a test is even happening?

---
Page: 289

*Hopefully, you can see the power of analytics for product teams.
However, as powerful as the role of data is for us, the most important thing to keep in mind about analytics is that the data will shine a light on what is happening, but it won’t explain why. We need our qualitative techniques to explain the quantitative results.*

**Evidence versus insight.

---
Page: 291

*For everything new we add, we ensure we have the necessary instrumentation in place to know immediately if it is working as we expect, and if there are signif i cant unintended consequences. Frankly, without that instru-mentation, I wouldn’t bother to roll out the feature. How would you know if it was working?
For most product managers, the f i rst thing they do in the morning is to check the analytics to see what happened during the preceding night. They’re usually running some form of test almost all the time, so they’re very interested in what’s happened.*

**What features are we actively monitoring and how?

---
Page: 291

*I’m very big on radically simplifying products by removing features that don’t carry their own weight. But, without knowing what is being used, and how it’s being used, it’s a very painful process to do this when you don’t know what’s really going on. We don’t have the data to back up our theories or decisions, so management (rightfully) balks.*

**Do we have any features that we can shed? 

**Can our customer support do other work when there's not a lot of traffic?

---
Page: 296

*Building a business is always hard. You must have a business model that’s viable. The costs to produce, market and sell your product must be suff i ciently less than the revenue your product generates. You must operate within the laws of the countries you sell in. You must hold up your end of business agreements and partnerships. Your product must f i t within the brand promise of your company’s other offerings.*

**Doesn't it make sense to do a light check for this up front? Spending effort on product discovery for something that turns out to be illegal seems like a waste of time.

---
Page: 301

*Be sure to be clear about whether you’re doing a user test, a product demo, or a walkthrough. And, be sure you’re skilled in how to do all three.*

**As we evolve our vocabulary of product discovery techniques we will become more and more precise with everything we do.

Page: 303

*One of many tests they tried was to move to a subscription service.
The idea was to get people to sign up for a month, and offer them unlimited movies. Would that be perceived as better enough to get them to change their media consumption behavior?
The good news was that, yes, this approach really did appeal to peo-ple. A f l at monthly fee and all the videos they could consume sounded pretty great.
The bad news is that the team created some real problems for themselves. No surprise that Netf l ix customers wanted to rent mostly newly released feature f i lms; yet, these were much more expensive for Netf l ix to stock, and they would need to stock so many copies of these that they’d very likely run out of money fast.
So, the product challenge became how they were going to make sure Netf l ix customers could watch a set of movies they would love, yet wouldn’t bankrupt the company.*

**Is there a business model waiting to be discovered in casual crypto usage? We have a pretty well tested model already. What makes people choose one wallet over another? One exchange over another? 

---
Page: 303

*So, the team got to work. In three months’ time, the team redesigned the site—introducing the queue, the rating system, and the recommendations engine all in support of Netf l ix as a subscription service.*

**Would we be able to deliver this in 3 months? I suppose it depends on the level of quality. 

---
Page: 308

*Another situation where a discov-ery sprint helps is when the team is just learning how to do product discovery. And yet another is when things are just moving too slow and the team needs to recalibrate on just how fast they can and should be moving.*

**We're in this category. We can absolutely take a week or two to get everyone aligned.

---
Page: 310

*Rather than f i ght this reality, we can embrace it. One of the sim-plest techniques for facilitating moving to new ways of working is the use of pilot teams. Pilot teams allow the roll out of change to a limited part of the organization before implementing it more broadly. The idea is that you look for a product team to volunteer to try out some new techniques. You let them run for a while (usually a quarter or two) with this new way of working and see how this goes.*

**We don't have a quarter to get this change off the ground. What do we do then?

---
Page: 311

*T o maximize the chance of the pilot teams having a good out-come, we carefully consider the people involved, their location, and their degree of autonomy. Ideally, we have people who are open to new ways of working, the key people on the team are co-located, and the team is largely in control of how they work and not so dependent on other teams that still work in the old way.*

**Maybe we can run this experiment with me and Hans in Barcelona? The conditions are the most ripe over there. We can also take it as an opportunity to get closer with that team.
