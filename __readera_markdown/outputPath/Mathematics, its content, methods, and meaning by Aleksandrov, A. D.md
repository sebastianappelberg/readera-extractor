*Finally, and this is obvious, mathematics as such moves almost wholly in the field of abstract concepts and their interrelations. While the natural scientist turns constantly to experiment for proof of his assertions, the mathematician employs only argument and computation.*

**Does this need to be the case? Could we one day have a rigorous study of empirical math?

*Mathematics demands that this result be deduced from the fundamental concepts of geometry, which at the present time, in view of the fact that geometry is nawadays developed on a rigorous basis, are precisely formulated in the axioms. And so it is in every case. To prove a theorem means for the mathematician to deduce it by a logical argument from the fundamental properties of the concepts occurring in that theorem. In this way, not only the concepts but also the methods of mathematics are abstract and theoretical.*

**How does one set coherent axioms?

*In the first place we make constant use, almost every hour, in industry and in private and social life, of the most varied concepts and results of mathematics, without thinking about them at all; for example, we use arithmetic to compute our expenses or geometry to calculate the floor area of an apartment. Of course, the rules here are very simple, but we should remember that in some period of antiquity they represented the most advanced mathematical achievements of the age.*

**I wonder what kind of maths will be table stakes in the future.

*So from observation, as for example of the deflection of a magnetic needle by an electric current, science proceeds to generalization, to a theory of the phenomena, and to formulation of laws and to mathematical expression of them. From these laws come new deductions, and finally, the theory is embodied in practice, which in its turn provides powerful new impulses for the development of the theory.*

**Mathematical theory is coevolved with empirical observations. Many times the real world is what prompts us to look for math that can make sense of it.

**In fact, every collection of objects, whether it be a flock of sheep or a pile of firewood, exists and is immediately perceived in all its concreteness and complexity. 
The distinguishing in it of separate properties and relationships is the result of conscious analysis. Primitive thought does not yet make this analysis, but considers the object only as a whole. Similarly, a man who has not studied music perceives a musical composition without distinguishing in it the details of melody, tonality, and so forth, while at the same time a musician easily analyzes even a complicated symphony.*

**We've lost something as we gained the ability to isolate stuff into separate things. But I definitely see it as a plausible progression as our neural networks get finer and finer resolution.

*The number of objects in a given collection is a property of the col- lection, but the number itself, as such, the “‘abstract number,” is a property abstracted from the concrete collection and considered simply in itself, like “‘blackness”’ or ‘‘hardness.”’*

**It's hard to imagine abstract concepts without attaching them to something.

*In the process of counting, men not only discovered and assimilated the relations among the separate numbers, as for example that two and three are five, but also they gradually established certain general laws. By prac- tical experience, it was discovered that a sum does not depend on the order of the summands and that the result of counting a given set of objects does not depend on the order in which the counting takes place, a fact which is reflected in the essential identity of the “ordinal” and ‘“‘cardinal’’ numbers: first, second, third, and one, two, three. In this way the numbers appeared not as separate and independent, but as interrelated with one another.*

**Are there relationships between numbers that we haven't invented or discovered yet? There are an infinite amount of ways that we could invent different ways for numbers to relates but is there something different about essential relationships such as addition, subtraction, and so on?

---
Page: 29

*This is understandable from the most general considerations. An arbitrary abstraction, removed from its concrete basis (just as a number is abstracted from a concrete collection of objects), has no sense ‘‘in itself’; it exists only in its relations with other concepts. These relations are already implicit in any statement about the abstraction, in the most incomplete definition of it. Without them the abstraction lacks content and significance, i.e., it simply does not exist. The content of the concept of an abstract number lies in the rules, in the mutual relations of the system of numbers.*

**I'm starting to see why the concreteness of math is what makes sure that it'll have a great breadth of application. 

---
Page: 29

*Thus the subject matter of arithmetic is relations among numbers. But these relations are the abstract images of actual quantitative relations among collections of objects; so we may say that arithmetic is the science of actual quantitative relations considered abstractly, that is, purely as relations. Arithmetic, as we see, did not arise from pure thought, as the idealists represent, but is the reflection of definite properties of real things; 
it arose from the long practical experience of many generations.*

**Going up and down in abstraction levels keeps you grounded and helps with understanding.

*As social life became more extensive and complicated, it posed broader problems. Not only was it necessary to take note of the number of objects in a set and to tell others about it, a necessity which had already led to formulation of the concept of number and to names for the numbers, but it became essential to learn to count increasingly larger collections, of animals in a herd, of objects for exchange, of days before a fixed date, and so forth, and to communicate the results of the count to others. This situation absolutely demanded improvement in the names and also in the symbols for numbers.*

**Math co-evolves with the needs of society. What kind of math do we desperately need in the present? It's clear that we need something to better understand complexity and quantum physics.

---
Page: 35

*General theorems about any property of an arbitrary number already contain in implicit form infinitely many assertions about the properties of separate numbers and are therefore qualitatively richer than any particular assertions that could be verified for specific numbers. It is for this reason that general theorems must be proved by general arguments proceeding from the fundamental rule for the formation of the sequence of numbers. 
Here we perceive a profound peculiarity of mathematics: Mathematics takes as its subject not only given quantitative relationships but all possible quantitative relationships and therefore infinity.*

**It's when we start stretching towards infinity that math leaves the realm of the concrete. It becomes computationally infeasible to work out any calculations with full precision. 

---
Page: 35

*We recall that a prime number is defined as a positive integer greater than unity which is divisible without remainder only by the number itself and by unity.*

**I did not know that one was also called unity. So there's zero, that represents emptiness, one represents unity, and infinity just infinity.

*1. How did the abstract concepts of arithmetic arise and what do they reflect in the actual world ? 
This question is answered by the earlier remarks about the birth of arithmetic. Its concepts correspond to the quantitative relations of collections of objects. These concepts arose by way of abstraction, as a result of the analysis and generalization of an immense amount of practical experience. They arose gradually; first came numbers connected with concrete objects, then abstract numbers, and finally the concept of number in general, of any possible number. Each of these concepts was made possible by a combination of practical experience and preceding abstract concepts. This, by the way, is one of the fundamental laws of formation of mathematical concepts: They are brought into being by a series of successive abstractions and generalizations, each resting on a combination of experience with preceding abstract concepts. The history of the concepts of arithmetic shows how mistaken is the idealistic view that they arose from “‘pure thought,” from “‘innate intuition,” from “contemplation of a priori forms,” or the like.*

**It's like the practical stakes out enough points in a dark space that we eventually are able to infer the full space. Thus we journey from many practical, concrete examples to something fully generalized and abstract. The abstraction is like a container, the examples are items in the container.

*The possibility of wide application is guaran- teed by the very abstractness of arithmetic, although it is important here that this abstraction is not an empty one but is derived from long practical experience. The same is true for all mathematics, and for any abstract concept or theory. The possibilities for application of a theory depend on the breadth of the original material which it generalizes.*

**Does this apply in any way to programming as well? 

---
Page: 37

*At the same time every abstract concept, in particular the concept of number, is limited in its significance as a result of its very abstractness. 
In the first place, when applied to any concrete object it reflects only one aspect of the object and therefore gives only an incomplete picture of it.*

**We create an idealized version of a scenario which many times can't be played out exactly in the real world. Adding two animals together for example might end with one animal eating the other, thus leaving one. 

---
Page: 38

*Moreover, abstract reflection often goes farther than the immediate demands of a practical problem.*

**This is what creates a certain kind of arbitrage by going abstract.

*But in nature itself our eyes seldom meet with really straight lines, with precise triangles or squares, and it is clear that the chief reason why men gradually worked out a conception of these figures is that their observation of nature was an active one, in the sense that, to meet their practical needs, they manu- factured objects more and more regular in shape. They built dwellings, cut stones, enclosed plots of land, stretched bowstrings in their bows, 20 I. A GENERAL VIEW OF MATHEMATICS modeled their clay pottery, brought it to perfection and correspondingly formed the notion that a pot is curved, but a stretched bowstring is straight. 
In short, they first gave form to their material and only then recognized form as that which is impressed on material and can therefore be con- sidered in itself, as an abstraction from material.*

**I wonder why we don't see perfect shapes in nature. And I wonder why we humans care about having them.

---
Page: 39

*Thus practical activity served as a basis for the abstract concepts of geometry. It was necessary to manufacture thousands of objects with straight edges, to stretch thousands of threads, to draw upon the ground a large number of straight lines, before men could form a clear notion of the straight line in general, as that quality which is common to all these particular cases.*

**Imagine starting from scratch, even just a line is not obvious in how to work abstractly with.

Page: 40

*But so far as we can tell, they were still not in possession of geometry as a theoretical science with theorems and proofs. Like the arithmetic of the time, geometry was basically a collection of rules deduced from experience. Moreover, geometry was in general not distinguished from arithmetic. Geometric problems were at the same time problems for calculation in arithmetic,*

**Mathematics contains abstractions that have been polished over thousands of years. Imagine having a programming abstraction that's been polished for that long, it'd be a diamond. 

---
Page: 41

*This abstraction necessarily leads to the purely theoretical method of geometry; it is no longer possible to set up experiments with breadthless straight lines, with “pure forms.’ The only possibility is to make use of logical argument, deriving some conclusions from others. A geometrical theorem must be proved by reasoning, otherwise it does not belong to geometry; it does not deal with “‘pure forms.”*

**Does it lose powers of applicability when becoming completely divorced from concrete reality? No, in fact it makes it more generally applicable to anything. It's a perfect abstraction of spatial forms and relations of bodies.

*To solve this problem, Fedorov made an abstraction from all the physical properties of a crystal, considering it only as a regular system of geometric bodies “in place of a system of concrete atoms.’ Thus the problem became one of finding all the forms of symmetry which could possibly exist in a system of geometric bodies. This purely geometrical problem was completely solved by Fedorov, who found all the possible forms of symmetry, 230 in number.*

**Math can light up the full space under investigation. What is it that determines the boundaries of the rooms it lights up?

*But in the process of measurement it turns out, generally speaking, that the chosen unit is not contained in the measured magnitude an integral number of times, so that a simple calculation of the number of units is not sufficient. It becomes necessary to divide up the unit of measurement in order to express the magnitude more accurately by parts of the unit; 
that is, no longer by whole numbers but by fractions. It was in this way that fractions actually arose, as is shown by an analysis of historical and other data. They arose from the division and comparison of continuous magnitudes; in other words, from measurement. The first magnitudes to be measured were geometric, namely lengths, areas of fields, and volumes of liquids or friable materials, so that in the earliest appearance of fractions we see the mutual action of arithmetic and geometry. This interaction leads to the appearance of an important new concept, namely of fractions, as an extension of the concept of number from whole numbers to fractional numbers (or as the mathematicians say, to rational numbers, expressing the ratio of whole numbers). Fractions did not arise, and could not arise, §4. ARITHMETIC AND GEOMETRY oo from the division of whole numbers, since only whole objects are counted by whole numbers. Three men, three arrows, and so forth, all these make sense, but two-thirds of a man and even two-thirds of an arrow are senseless concepts; even three separate thirds of an arrow will not kill a deer, for this it is necessary to have a whole arrow.*

**Fractions were born out of arithmetic, geometry and practical needs. The lineage of math is very interesting and somehow makes sense as you trace it back.

*Moreover, in returning in thought to the times of Democritus, one must attempt to free oneself of the customary notions of today, which have become firmly fixed in our minds by the development of mathematics. 
At the time of Democritus, geometrical figures were not yet separated from actual ones to the same extent as is now the case. Since Democritus considered actual bodies as consisting of atoms, he naturally also regarded geometrical figures in the same light.*

**Have we lost anything by not considering math and the real world as close anymore?

*But if (p/q)? = 2, then p? = 2q?, and therefore p? is divisible by 2. In this case p? is also divisible by 4, since it is the square of an even number. So p? = 4q,; that is, 29? = 4g, , and g® = 2q,. From this it follows that g must also be divisible by 2. But this contradicts the supposition that p and g have no common factor. This contradiction proves that the ratio b/a cannot be expressed by a rational number. The diagonal and the side of a square are incommensurable.*

**I love the simplicity of this line of reasoning. 

---
Page: 46

*This number (ratio) may be integral, rational, or if the given magnitude is incommensurable with the unit, irrational. 
A real number in its original sense is therefore nothing but the ratio of One magnitude to another taken as a unit; in particular cases this is a ratio of intervals, but it may also be a ratio of areas, weights, and so forth. 
Consequently, a real number is a ratio of magnitudes in general, considered in abstraction from their concrete nature. 
Just as abstract whole numbers are of mathematical interest only in their relations with one another, so abstract real numbers have content and become an object of mathematical attention only in relation with one another in the system of real numbers. 
In the theory of real numbers, just as in arithmetic, it is first necessary to define operations on numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, di- vision, and also the relations expressed by such words as “greater than” or “less than.” These operations and relations reflect actual connections among the various magnitudes; for example, addition reflects the placing together of intervals.*

**Now I understand why real numbers are in fact entirely different than the whole numbers. Their concrete origin is completely different. It's a different way of conceptualizing quantities and their relationships. Geometry is a beautiful bridge between the two.

Page: 49

*In every case when one passes beyond well-known limits of quantitative accuracy, there appears a qualitative change in the magnitude, and in general it loses its original meaning. For example, the pressure of a gas cannot be made precise beyond the limits of the impact of a single molecule; electric charge ceases to be continuous when one tries to make it precise beyond the charge on an electron and so forth.*

**What if there are infinitely deeper levels that we'll be able to detect as our instruments get better? Or what if that's the highest possible resolution we can measure at. 

---
Page: 50

*In this way a mathematical theory of magnitudes, since it considers magnitudes in abstraction from their individual nature, must inevitably consider the possibility of unlimited accuracy for the value of the magni- tude and must thereby lead to the concept of a real number. At the same time, since it reflects only what is common to various magnitudes, mathe- matics takes no account of the peculiarity of each individual magnitude. 
Since mathematics selects only general properties for consideration, it operates with its clearly defined abstractions quite independently of the actual limits of their applicability, as must happen precisely because these limits are different in different particular cases. These limits depend on the concrete properties of the phenomena under consideration and on the qualitative changes that take place in them. So in making an application of mathematics, it is necessary to verify the actual applicability of the theory in question. To consider matter as continuous and to describe its properties by continuous magnitudes is permissible only if we may abstract from its atomic structure, and this is possible only under well-known conditions.*

**Even if something is proven mathematically, you still need to run the experiment when you want to instantiate the fact in a particular situation. Base reality isn't continuous, or it doesn't seem that way at least.

*On this theme of division there is a humorous question which is extra- ordinarily instructive. Grandmother has bought three potatoes and must divide them equally between two grandsons. How is she to do it? The answer is: make mashed potatoes. 
The joke reveals the very essence of the matter. Separate objects are indivisible in the sense that, when divided, the object almost always ceases to be what it was before, as is clear from the example of “thirds of a man” or “thirds of an arrow.”’ On the other hand, continuous and homogenous magnitudes or objects may easily be divided and put together again without losing their essential character. Mashed potatoes offer an excellent example of a homogeneous object, which in itself is not separated into parts but may nevertheless be divided in practice into as small parts as desired. Lengths, areas, and volumes have the same property. Although they are continuous in their very essence and are not actually divided into parts, nevertheless they offer the possibility of being divided without limit. 
Here we encounter two contrasting kinds of objects: on the one hand, the indivisible, separate, discrete objects; and on the other, the objects which are completely divisible and yet are not divided into parts but are continuous. Of course, these contrasting characteristics are always united, since there are no absolutely indivisible and no completely continuous objects. Yet these aspects of the objects have an actual existence, and it often happens that one aspect is decisive in one case and the other in another.*

**Any kind of water or gas like substance has a bit of a continuous character to it. Or rather, it's when there's a total homogeneity to very small components that always come as a group.

*Such is the general rule. The old theories, by giving rise to new and profound problems, outgrow themselves, as it were, and demand for further progress new forms and new ideas. But these forms and ideas may demand new historical conditions for their birth. In ancient society the conditions necessary for the passage to higher mathematics did not and could not exist; they came on the scene with the development of the natural sciences in modern times, a development which in its turn was conditioned in the 16th and 17th centuries by the new demands of techno- logy and of manufacturing and was connected in this way with the birth and development of capitalism.*

**Where are we on that curve today? Does progress demand faster innovation in order to sustain itself? If that's the case, we should focus on planting the seeds for creating generations that are more and more capable of it.

*As a reflection of the general properties of change, there arose in mathematics the concepts of a variable magnitude and a function, and it was this cardinal extension of the subject matter of mathematics that determined the transition to a new stage, to the mathematics of variable magnitudes. 
The law of motion of a body in a given trajectory, for example along a straight line, is defined by the manner in which the distance covered by the body increases with time.*

**I didn't really reflect on it but it's true that arithmetic and geometry are more static in nature. 

---
Page: 62

*In general, the law of motion expresses the distance covered in the time t. Here the time t and the distance s are respectively the “independent” and the “dependent” variable, and the fact that to each time ¢ there cor- responds a definite distance s is what is meant by saying that the distance s is a function of the time f.*

**When you think about the real world application of a formula you the variables get a little bit more meaning.

---
Page: 64

*This formula states that the magnitude y is in general some function of x; 
that is, to each value assumed by x there corresponds, in some fashion or another, a definite value y. The subject matter of mathematics thus consists not only of certain given functions (y = $ax®, y = sin x, and so forth), but of arbitrary (more accurately, more or less arbitrary) functions. 
These degrees of abstraction, first from concrete magnitudes and then from concrete functions, are analogous to the degrees of abstraction observed in the formation of the concept of a whole number: First, abstraction from concrete collections of objects led to the concept of whole numbers (1, 3, 12, and so forth), and then a further abstraction led to the concept of an arbitrary whole number in general. This generalization is the result of a profound interraction between analysis and synthesis: 
analysis of separate interrelations and synthesis, in the form of new con- cepts, of their common features.*

**I didn't quite appreciate what a refined abstraction something so simple as y = f(x) is. 

---
Page: 64

*Since a function is the abstract image of a dependence of one magnitude on another, we may say that analysis takes as its subject matter depend- ences between variable magnitudes, not between one concrete magnitude and another but between variables in general, in abstraction from their content. An abstraction of this sort guarantees great breadth of applica- tion, since one formula or one theorem contains an infinite number of possible concrete cases. An example of this is given already by our simple formulas (1)+5). So the complete analogy of analysis with arithmetic and algebra becomes evident. They all originate in definite practical problems and give a general abstract expression to concrete relationships in the actual world.*

**How does one know when to the given abstraction fits a concrete problem? 

---
Page: 69

*The theory of differential equations, the most important branch of analysis, has to do with equations in which the unknown is no longer a magnitude but a function, or in other words a law governing the depend- ence of one magnitude on another or on several others. It is easy to under- stand how such equations arose. In mechanics we seek to determine the whole law of motion of a body under given conditions and not just one value of the velocity or of the distance covered. In the mechanics of fluids it is necessary to find the distribution of velocity over the whole mass of fluid in motion, or in other words to find the dependence of the velocity on all three space coordinates and on time. Analogously, in the theory of electricity and magnetism we must find the tension in the field throughout all space; that is, the dependence of this tension on the same three space coordinates, and similarly in other cases.*

**I would like to get to a place where I grokk all of this.

*We can deduce general laws for the vibration of strings and membranes, and for the propagation of vibrations in various media; here we are referring to sound waves, electromagnetic waves, or elastic vibrations propagated through the Earth by earthquakes or explosions.*

**Is there any public dataset that one could play around with to confirm the mathematics of earthquakes?

---
Page: 72

*Analysis, or more precisely the theory of differential equations, allows us not merely to find separate values for variable magnitudes but also to determine unknown functions; that is, to find laws of dependence of certain variables on others.*

**Could analysis be used for deep learning instead of linear algebra?

---
Page: 73

*The necessary period of criticism, systematization, and laying of founda- tions occurred in analysis at the beginning of the last century. Through the efforts of a number of eminent scientists this important and difficult work was brought to a successful completion. In particular, precise definitions were given for the basic concepts of real number, variable, function, limit, and continuity.*

**It's interesting that you can use the system to great effect without having finished the foundation. That tells me that you can go quite far without rigor. 

---
Page: 79

*essence of this new branch of mathematics consists briefly in the following. In classical analysis the variable is a magnitude, or “‘number,”’ but in functional analysis the function itself is regarded as the variable. 
The properties of the given function are determined here not in themselves but in relation to other functions. What is under study is not a separate function but a whole collection of functions characterized by one property or another; for example, the collection of all continuous functions. Such a collection of functions forms the so-called functional space. This procedure corresponds, for example, to the fact that we may consider the collection of all curves on a surface or of all possible motions of a given mechanical system, thereby defining the properties of the separate curves or motions in their relation to other curves or motions.*

**It's a very meta field. I wonder if it's possible to make neural networks more meta.

Page: 82

*The characteristic feature of modern mathematics may be said to be that its subject matter consists not only of given quantitative relations and forms but of all possible ones. In geometry, we speak not only of spatial relations and forms but of all possible forms similar to spatial ones. In algebra, we speak of various abstract systems of objects with all possible laws of operation on them. In analysis, not only magnitudes are considered as variables but the very functions themselves. In a functional space all the functions of a given type (all the possible interdependences among the variables) are brought together. Summing up, it is possible to say that while elementary mathematics deals with constant magnitudes, and the next period with variable magnitudes, contemporary mathematics is the mathematics of all possible (in general, variable) quantitative relations and interdependences among magnitudes.*

**What comes next? Is there a limit to mathematical knowledge? 

---
Page: 90

*Thus, after the creation of analysis, there followed a period of tempestu- ous development of its applications to the most varied branches of tech- nology and natural science. Since it is founded on abstraction from the special features of particular problems, mathematical analysis reflects the actual deep-lying properties of the material world; and this is the reason why it provides the means for investigation of such a wide range of practical questions. The mechanical motion of solid bodies, the motion of liquids and gases of their particular particles, their laws of flow in the mass, the conduction of heat and electricity, the course of chemical reactions, all these phenomena are studied in the corresponding sciences by means of mathematical analysis.*

**What is our next mathematical revolution going to unlock? Perhaps understanding of complex adaptive systems?

---
Page: 98

*But one must not think that a formula is the only method of defining a function. There are many other methods; for example, the graph of the function, which gives a visual geometric picture of it.*

**Don't be blinded by the tools you use. The point in this case is to understand the relationship between a variable and a magnitude, for example how does the air temperature change over time? There ought to be many ways of capturing and predicting this, a formula is just a very compact and powerful way to do it.

*Thus the case when the numerator and the denominator of the fraction both approach zero cannot be dealt with in advance by general theorems, and for each particular fraction of this kind it is necessary to make a special investigation.*

**Is it the case that we'll never be able to find a general theorem for these? Are such types called something? 

---
Page: 106

*Let us also consider for the moment the following geometric example. 
In elementary geometry the figures considered first are those bounded by straight line segments. But later there arises the more difficult task of finding the length of the circumference of a circle with given radius. 
If we analyze the difficulties connected with the solution of this problem, we find that they reduce to the following. 
We must give an answer to the question, what is meant by the length of the circumference; that is, we must give a precise definition of this length. It is essential that the definition should be expressible in terms of the lengths of straight-line segments and also that it should provide us with the possibility of effectively calculating the length of the circum- ference. 
It is understood, of course, that the result of this calculation should be in agreement with practical experience. For example, if we consider a circumference consisting of an actual thread, then, if we cut the thread and stretch it out, we must obtain a segment whose length, within the limits of accuracy of measurement, coincides with our computed length. 
As is known from elementary geometry, the solution of this problem reduces to the following definition. The length of a circumference is defined to be the limit approached by the perimeter of a regulart polygon inscribed in it as the number of sides of the polygon increases beyond all bounds. Thus the solution of the problem is based essentially on the concept of a limit. 
The length of an arbitrary smooth curve is defined in the same way.*

**It's kind of weird that we have to bruteforce the calculation of something that's curved.

*These discontinuous functions in mathematics represent the numerous jumplike processes to be met with in nature. In the case of a sudden blow, for example, the value of the velocity of a body changes in such a jump- like fashion. Many qualitative transitions take place with such jumps. 
In §2 we introduced the function Q = f(t), expressing the way in which the quantity of heat in a given quantity of water (or ice) depends on the temperature. In the neighborhood of the melting point of ice the quantity of heat Q = f(t) changes in a jumplike fashion with changing ¢.*

**Discontinuities are interesting because they can represent phase shifts.

*All the three problems discussed, in spite of the fact that they refer to different branches of science, namely mechanics, geometry, and the theory of electricity, have led to one and the same mathematical operation to be performed on a given function, namely to find the limit of the ratio of the increase of the function to the corresponding increase h of the independent variable as h-»0. The number of such widely different problems could be increased at will, and their solution would lead to the same operation. To it we are led, for example, by the question of the rate of a chemical reaction, or of the density of a nonhomogeneous mass and so forth. In view of the exceptional role played by this operation on functions, it has received a special name, differentiation, and the result of the operation is called the derivative of the function.*

**Rate of change at a particular value for the independent variable is universally useful. What universally useful properties can be drawn from problems of emergence and complex adaptive systems? Scale gives some of these.

*But it must be said that Newton and Leibnitz and their contemporaries provided very little logical basis for their great mathematical discoveries; 
§5. DERIVATIVE 97 in their methods of reasoning and in the concepts with which they operated there was much that is unclear from our point of view. Even at that time the mathematicians themselves were quite conscious of this, as is shown by the embittered discussions to be found in their correspondence with one another. However, these mathematicians of the 17th and 18th centuries carried on their purely mathematical activities in very close association with the research of other investigators, in the various branches of natural science (physics, mechanics, chemistry, technology). The statement of a mathematical problem usually arose from practical needs or from a wish to understand some phenomenon of nature, and as soon as the problem was solved, the solution was submitted in one way or another to a practical test. Consequently, in spite of a certain lack of logical basis, mathematics was able to advance in extremely useful directions.*

**Engineering beats pure math when it comes to usefulness. Do we have these feedback cycles between math and scientific problems today? It feels like we're not as in harmony anymore.

*We have already noted at the beginning of the chapter that the concept of a derivative arose chiefly as the result of many centuries of effort directed towards the solving of two problems: drawing a tangent to a curve and finding the velocity of a nonuniform motion.*

**It's fascinating that an esoteric geometric problem has such wide applicability to understanding the world.

*Thus the box will have the greatest volume, equal to 2/27 a’, for the height x = a/6.*

**This is a universal truth then for squares and boxes. Do we this ratio in nature?

*Significance of the second derivative; convexity and concavity. The second derivative has a simple significance in mechanics. Let s = f(t) be a law of motion along a straight line; then s’ is the velocity and s” is the “velocity of the change in the velocity”’ or more simply the ‘‘accelera- tion’ of the point at time ¢. For example, for a falling body under the force of gravity*

**The fact that applying the same function twice gives you two different insights into a problem is pretty cool.

*But though we became acquainted with the most important properties of these functions, we found no answer in elementary mathematics to the question: How can we calculate them? What sort of operations, for example, is it necessary to perform on x in order to obtain log x or sin x? 
The answer to this question is given by methods that have been worked out in analysis.*

**We take the elementary operations for granted but we forget that they too have to defined, calculated and operationalized.

*On an interval containing the point a, let there be given a function f(x) with derivatives of every order.*

**An example of such a function is sinx or cosx. You can take the derivative of those however many times you'd like.

*The laws of nature, as a rule, can be expressed with good approximation by functions that may be differentiated as often as we like and that in their turn may be approximated by polynomials, the degree of the polynom- ial being determined by the accuracy desired.*

**Is the fact that we have to approximate them just a sign that we haven't found the true explanation and equation for them or will we always need to approximate?
