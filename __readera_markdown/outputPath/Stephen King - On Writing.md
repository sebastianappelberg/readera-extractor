*At some point I began to write my own stories. Imi-tation preceded creation; I would copy Combat Caseycomics word for word in my Blue Horse tablet, sometimes adding my own descriptions where they seemed appropriate.*

**Our most ancient form of teaching and learning. Imitation. After you've grasped the shape of what you're imitating you start getting a feel for where the range of motions are, where you can put your own stuff in. You start grasping the general and the specifics of the thing. Can imitation be the way forward for AGI?

*She asked me if I had made the story up myself, and I was forced to admit that I had copied most of it out of a funny-book. She seemed disappointed, and that drained away much of my pleasure. At last she handed back my tablet. “Write one of your own, Stevie,” she said. “Those Combat Caseyfunny-books are just junk—he’s always knocking someone’s teeth out. I bet you could do better. Write one of your own.”*

**Encouraging someone to be original is an act of love, it's you trying to maximize their freedom and potential. Don't hesitate to be harsh on someone if you know they can do better.

*I eventually wrote a story about four magic animals who rode around in an old car, helping out little kids. Their leader was a large white bunny named Mr. Rabbit Trick. He got to drive the car. The story was four pages long, laboriously printed in pencil.*

**Original content, no matter how bad, is he best form of creation. Stephen King has been so extremely prolific and what's interesting is that he has written some of the worst novels to ever exist to some of the best. I believe that it's his fearlessness in terms of getting stuff out there that has given him so many shots at goal that he has done so many masterpieces.

*I remember an immense feeling of possibilityat the idea, as if I had been ushered into a vast building filled with closed doors and had been given leave to open any I liked. There were more doors than one person could ever open in a life-time, I thought (and still think).*

**There's nothing stopping you from exploring whatever you want. In your mind you have endless possibilities in terms of fantasy.

*Let’s get one thing clear right now, shall we? There is no Idea Dump, no Story Central, no Island of the Buried Bestsellers;
good story ideas seem to come quite literally from nowhere, sailing at you right out of the empty sky: two previously unrelated ideas come together and make something new under the sun. Your job isn’t to find these ideas but to recog-nize them when they show up.*

**He describes a non-objective search. Just keep cresting, just keep doing what you find interesting but be very attentive so you know when your close to genius.

*The hero of my story was your classic Poor Schmuck, a guy named Roger who had done jail time twice for counter-feiting money—one more bust would make him a three-time loser.*

**Are some people innately closer to knowing humanity's archetypes? Like they're so in touch with them that they needn't even have even met them to fully empathize with their being.

*Horror movies, science fiction movies, movies about teenage gangs on the prowl, movies about losers on motor-cycles—this was the stuff that turned my dials up to ten.*

**What are the things that make your heart race? Focus on getting closer to those things. I really enjoy hearing people talk about complexity, ecosystems, things that let us understand the world more deeply. Inventions and honestly superhero shit does it too. What is the inspiration for all that you do?

*The stencils had cost me $1.71 (having to use up one whole stencil for the title page seemed a hideous waste of money, but you had to look good, I’d reluctantly decided; you had to go out there with a bit of the old attitude), the paper had cost another two bits or so, the staples were free, cribbed from my brother (you might have to paperclip stories you were sending out to magazines, but this was a book,this was the bigtime).*

**For creators their vision is more important than the means to get there. For the entrepreneur the means will inform what visions are feasible. True geniuses are able to do both.

*After a half-hour or so of pleasant mulling, I typed the words A V.I.B. BOOKin the upper right corner of my title page. V.I.B. stood for Very Important Book.*

**Small stylistic choices that highlight your own voice is what differentiates your work from anyone else's.

*I was ashamed. I have spent a good many years since—too many, I think—being ashamed about what I write. I think I was forty before I realized that almost every writer of fiction and poetry who has ever published a line has been accused by someone of wasting his or her God-given tal-ent. If you write (or paint or dance or sculpt or sing, I sup-pose), someone will try to make you feel lousy about it, that’s all. I’m not editorializing, just trying to give you the facts as I see them.*

**Trying to clean up shame can be one of the greatest sources of hustle.

*The Drumdid not prosper under my editorship. Then as now, I tend to go through periods of idleness followed by peri-ods of workaholic frenzy.*

**I too have this, is it a matter of hormone cycles or something?

*In my character, a kind of wildness and a deep conser-vatism are wound together like hair in a braid.*

**Yet again I recognize myself in him.

*At the time we’re stuck in it, like hostages locked in a Turk-ish bath, high school seems the most serious business in the world to just about all of us. It’s not until the second or third class reunion that we start realizing how absurd the whole thing was.*

**Most of life you look back and think about how weird it was.

*“When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story,” he said. “When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are notthe story.”*

**The first draft is for yourself.

*Her poem also made me feel that I wasn’t alone in my belief that good writing can be simultaneously intoxicating and idea-driven. If stone-sober people can fuck like they’re out of their minds—can actually be out of their minds while caught in that throe—why shouldn’t writers be able to go bonkers and still stay sane?*

**The genius that comes to you can be called through tight mechanics. Know your craft, know what you're doing, do lots of it, you will reduce imperfections more and more until you pull out an idea that's awesome and you're able to bring it fully to life.

*Tabby never voiced a single doubt, however. Her support was a constant, one of the few good things I could take as a given. And whenever I see a first novel dedicated to a wife (or a husband), I smile and think, There’s someone who knows.Writ-ing is a lonely job. Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference. They don’t have to make speeches.
Just believing is usually enough.*

**Every voiced doubt is dragging you down towards the pit.

*I wasn’t having much success with my own writing, either.
Horror, science fiction, and crime stories in the men’s maga-zines were being replaced by increasingly graphic tales of sex. That was part of the trouble, but not all of it. The bigger deal was that, for the first time in my life, writing was hard.
The problem was the teaching. I liked my coworkers and loved the kids—even the Beavis and Butt-Head types in Liv-ing with English could be interesting—but by most Friday afternoons I felt as if I’d spent the week with jumper cables clamped to my brain. If I ever came close to despairing about my future as a writer, it was then. I could see myself thirty years on, wearing the same shabby tweed coats with patches on the elbows, potbelly rolling over my Gap khakis from too much beer. I’d have a cigarette cough from too many packs of Pall Malls, thicker glasses, more dandruff, and in my desk drawer, six or seven unfinished manuscripts which I would take out and tinker with from time to time, usually when drunk. If asked what I did in my spare time, I’d tell people I was writing a book—what else does anyself-respecting creative-writing teacher do with his or her spare time? And of course I’d lie to myself, telling myself there was still time, it wasn’t too late, there were novelists who didn’t get started until they were fifty, hell, even sixty. Probably plenty of them.*

**Life can prevent you from doing what you want. That's why it's important to find a way of making money of it, then it'll let you spend all your time on it.

**The competitive landscape has great influence over your work.

*The story remained on the back burner for awhile, simmering away in that place that’s not quite the conscious but not quite the subconscious, either.*

**Those are the thoughts that pop out at you in the shower.

*I had four problems with what I’d written. First and least important was the fact that the story didn’t move me emo-tionally. Second and slightly more important was the fact that I didn’t much like the lead character. Carrie White seemed thick and passive, a ready-made victim. The other girls were chucking tampons and sanitary napkins at her, chanting “Plug it up! Plug it up!” and I just didn’t care.
Third and more important still was not feeling at home with either the surroundings or my all-girl cast of supporting char-acters. I had landed on Planet Female, and one sortie into the girls’ locker room at Brunswick High School years before wasn’t much help in navigating there. For me writing has always been best when it’s intimate, as sexy as skin on skin.
With CarrieI felt as if I were wearing a rubber wet-suit I couldn’t pull off. Fourth and most important of all was the realization that the story wouldn’t pay off unless it was pretty long, probably even longer than “Sometimes They Come Back,” which had been at the absolute outer limit of what the men’s magazine market could accept in terms of word-count.*

**This is contrary to what you usually hear as advice. It seems that you don't always have to write what you know, you can learn and imagine and gain an understanding and honestly when you're coming from a fresh perspective it might be more valuable. Also that your best work might not immediately jive with you. Get some feedback and let others help you know if you're onto something. 

---
Page: 73

*The most important is that the writer’s original perception of a character or characters may be as erroneous as the reader’s. Running a close second was the realization that stopping a piece of work just because it’s hard, either emo-tionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea.*

**When it feels hard you know you're working at the edge of your abilities.

*Her peers had no intention of letting her out of the box they’d put her in;
she was punished for even trying to break free. I had several classes with her, and was able to observe Dodie’s ruination at first hand. I saw her smile fade, saw the light in her eyes first dim and then go out. By the end of the day she was the girl she’d been before Christmas vacation—a dough-faced and freckle-cheeked wraith, scurrying through the halls with her eyes down and her books clasped to her chest.*

**Bullying at its worst.

*I know how he felt. It’s been almost twelve years since I took a drink, and I’m still struck by disbelief when I see someone in a restaurant with a half-finished glass of wine near at hand. I want to get up, go over, and yell “Finish that!
Why don’t you finish that?” into his or her face. I found the idea of social drinking ludicrous—if you didn’t want to get drunk, why not just have a Coke?*

**Addiction is overrationale.

---
Page: 95

*Hemingway and Fitzgerald didn’t drink because they were creative, alienated, or morally weak. They drank because it’s what alkies are wired up to do. Creative people probably dorun a greater risk of alcoholism and addiction than those in some other jobs, but so what? We all look pretty much the same when we’re puking in the gutter.*

**Are creative people like this because they are hyperdopaminergic?

---
Page: 97

*It starts with this: put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn’t in the middle of the room. Life isn’t a support-system for art.
It’s the other way around.*

**Does he mean that you should distance yourself from it? To not let it consume you? I guess this is what Frankenstein warns about too.

---
Page: 102

*I didn’t tell you. You didn’t ask me. I never opened my mouth and you never opened yours.
We’re not even in the same yeartogether, let alone the same room . . . except we aretogether. We’re close.
We’re having a meeting of the minds.
I sent you a table with a red cloth on it, a cage, a rabbit, and the number eight in blue ink. You got them all, espe-cially that blue eight. We’ve engaged in an act of telepathy.
No mythy-mountain shit; real telepathy.*

**The writer and the reader have a telepathic connection. The writer is transmitting and the reader is receiving. 

---
Page: 112

*Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful.If you hesitate and cogitate, you will come up with another word—of course you will, there’s always another word—but it probably won’t be as good as your first one, or as close to what you really mean.*

**Don't be embarrassed, be yourself.

---
Page: 108

*I want to suggest that to write to your best abilities, it behooves you to construct your own toolbox and then build up enough muscle so you can carry it with you. Then, instead of looking at a hard job and getting discouraged, you will perhaps seize the correct tool and get immediately to work.*

**With a deep toolbox you'll have something you can use.

---
Page: 115

*Take any noun, put it with any verb, and you have a sen-tence. It never fails. Rocks explode. Jane transmits. Moun-tains float.These are all perfect sentences. Many such thoughts make little rational sense, but even the stranger ones (Plums deify!) have a kind of poetic weight that’s nice. The simplicity of noun-verb construction is useful—at the very least it can provide a safety net for your writing. Strunk and White caution against too many simple sentences in a row, but simple sentences provide a path you can follow when you fear getting lost in the tangles of rhetoric—all those restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses, those modifying phrases, those appositives and compound-complex sentences. If you start to freak out at the sight of such unmapped territory (unmapped by you, at least), just remind yourself that rocks explode, Jane transmits, mountains float, and plums deify. Grammar is not just a pain in the ass; it’s the pole you grab to get your thoughts up on their feet and walking.*

**Great works can be built from simple building blocks. 

---
Page: 116

*Verbs come in two types, active and passive. With an active verb, the subject of the sentence is doing something.
With a passive verb, something is being done tothe subject of the sentence. The subject is just letting it happen. You should avoid the passive tense.I’m not the only one who says so; you can find the same advice in The Elements of Style.*

**Passive verbs are more timid. Active verbs are simpler and more straight to the point. 

---
Page: 118

*You might also notice how much simpler the thought is to understand when it’s broken up into twothoughts. This makes matters easier for the reader, and the reader must always be your main concern; without Constant Reader, you are just a voice quacking in the void. And it’s no walk in the park being the guy on the receiving end.*

**How can you make something as simple as possible for the reader? Every line of thought in a sentence adds weight that is carried to the end of it. 

---
Page: 118

*Adverbs, you will remember from your own version of Business English, are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They’re the ones that usually end in -ly.
Adverbs, like the passive voice, seem to have been created with the timid writer in mind. With the passive voice, the writer usually expresses fear of not being taken seriously; it is the voice of little boys wearing shoepolish mustaches and lit-tle girls clumping around in Mommy’s high heels. With adverbs, the writer usually tells us he or she is afraid he/she isn’t expressing himself/herself clearly, that he or she is not getting the point or the picture across.*

**Let the context speak for itself. 

---
Page: 121

*The best form of dialogue attribution is said,as in he said, she said, Bill said, Monica said.If you want to see this put stringently into practice, I urge you to read or reread a novel by Larry McMurtry, the Shane of dialogue attribution.
That looks damned snide on the page, but I’m speaking with complete sincerity. McMurtry has allowed few adverbial dan-delions to grow on his lawn. He believes in he-said/she-said even in moments of emotional crisis (and in Larry McMurtry novels there are a lot of those). Go and do thou likewise.*

**Create consistency in your dialogue attribution by defining rules for it. 

---
Page: 121

*I’m convinced that fear is at the root of most bad writing.
If one is writing for one’s own pleasure, that fear may be mild—timidityis the word I’ve used here. If, however, one is working under deadline—a school paper, a newspaper arti-cle, the SAT writing sample—that fear may be intense.
Dumbo got airborne with the help of a magic feather; you may feel the urge to grasp a passive verb or one of those nasty adverbs for the same reason. Just remember before you do that Dumbo didn’t need the feather; the magic was in him.*

**You grab for social affirmation when you're unsure of yourself. Don't do it. It leads to art that has no spine. 

---
Page: 122

*Good writing is often about letting go of fear and affecta-tion. Affectation itself, beginning with the need to define some sorts of writing as “good” and other sorts as “bad,” is fear-ful behavior. Good writing is also about making good choices when it comes to picking the tools you plan to work with.*

**The mechanics of good writing is as mechanic as clean code. Make consistent, thoughtful choices that follows good practices. 

---
Page: 124

*Paragraphs are almost as important for how they look as for what they say; they are maps of intent.*

**If paragraphs are maps of intent, keep them single-purpose to not overwhelm the reader with complexity. 

---
Page: 125

*Even in the informal essay, however, it’s possible to see how strong the basic paragraph form can be. Topic-sentence-followed-by-support-and-description insists that the writer organize his/her thoughts, and it also provides good insur-ance against wandering away from the topic. Wandering isn’t a big deal in an informal essay, is practically de rigueur,as a matter of fact—but it’s a very bad habit to get into when working on more serious subjects in a more formal manner.
Writing is refined thinking.*

**Every word, sentence, paragraph and chapter should have a reason for its existence and a thoughtful placing. 

---
Page: 125

*In fiction, the paragraph is less structured—it’s the beat instead of the actual melody. The more fiction you read and write, the more you’ll find your paragraphs forming on their own. And that’s what you want.*

**Very interesting how the basic components should be used differently depending on what type of prose it is.

---
Page: 126

*It would encompass dialogue attribution (not necessary if we know who’s speaking*

**I've never figured this one out quite as well as I'd like. Dialogue attribution has always felt awkward to me.

---
Page: 128

*I would argue that the paragraph, not the sentence, is the basic unit of writing—the place where coherence begins and words stand a chance of becoming more than mere words. If the moment of quickening is to come, it comes at the level of the paragraph. It is a marvellous and flexible instrument that can be a single word long or run on for pages*

**Practice, practice, practice. Find your beat.

---
Page: 128

*Language does not always have to wear a tie and lace-up shoes. The object of fiction isn’t grammati-cal correctness but to make the reader welcome and then tell a story . . . to make him/her forget, whenever possible, that he/she is reading a story at all. The single-sentence para-graph more closely resembles talk than writing, and that’s good. Writing is seduction. Good talk is part of seduction. If not so, why do so many couples who start the evening at din-ner wind up in bed?*

**It's telepathy. You, your prose and your reader are engaged in a dance. You need to hear the rhythm of your own beat for it to be transmittable. 

---
Page: 130

*You go on to the third level, of course, and begin to write real fiction. Why shouldn’t you? Why should you fear? Car-penters don’t build monsters, after all; they build houses, stores, and banks. They build some of wood a plank at a time and some of brick a brick at a time. You will build a para-graph at a time, constructing these of your vocabulary and your knowledge of grammar and basic style. As long as you stay level-on-the-level and shave even every door, you can build whatever you like—whole mansions, if you have the energy.*

**I want the ability to clearly see each component of a text and judge the quality at the level of particles. 

---
Page: 134

*The next level is much smaller. These are the really good writers. Above them—above almost all of us—are the Shakespeares, the Faulkners, the Yeatses, Shaws, and Eudora Weltys. They are geniuses, divine accidents, gifted in a way which is beyond our ability to understand, let alone attain.
Shit, most geniuses aren’t able to understand themselves, and many of them lead miserable lives, realizing (at least on some level) that they are nothing but fortunate freaks, the intellectual version of runway models who just happen to be born with the right cheekbones and with breasts which fit the image of an age.*

**In what domain might you be a divine accident? Go there, your impact will be outsized compared to other's. 

---
Page: 137

*If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut.
I’m a slow reader, but I usually get through seventy or eighty books a year, mostly fiction. I don’t read in order to study the craft; I read because I like to read. It’s what I do at night, kicked back in my blue chair. Similarly, I don’t read fiction to study the art of fiction, but simply because I like stories. Yet there is a learning process going on. Every book you pick up has its own lesson or lessons, and quite often the bad books have more to teach than the good ones.*

**Slodging through bad books might have a benefit to it after all. 

---
Page: 139

*You may find yourself adopting a style you find particularly exciting, and there’s nothing wrong with that. When I read Ray Bradbury as a kid, I wrote like Ray Bradbury—every-thing green and wondrous and seen through a lens smeared with the grease of nostalgia. When I read James M. Cain, everything I wrote came out clipped and stripped and hard-boiled. When I read Lovecraft, my prose became luxurious and Byzantine. I wrote stories in my teenage years where all these styles merged, creating a kind of hilarious stew. This sort of stylistic blending is a necessary part of developing one’s own style, but it doesn’t occur in a vacuum. You have to read widely, constantly refining (and redefining) your own work as you do so.*

**Your information diet will influence what grows in your head.

---
Page: 142

*What this suggested to me was that when it came to the sax and my son, there was never going to be any real play-time; it was all going to be rehearsal. That’s no good. If there’s no joy in it, it’s just no good. It’s best to go on to some other area, where the deposits of talent may be richer and the fun quotient higher.*

**Can I lose myself in what I do? Can I play?

---
Page: 145

*Once I start work on a project, I don’t stop and I don’t slow down unless I absolutely have to. If I don’t write every day, the characters begin to stale off in my mind—they begin to seemlike characters instead of real people. The tale’s narra-tive cutting edge starts to rust and I begin to lose my hold on the story’s plot and pace. Worst of all, the excitement of spinning something new begins to fade. The work starts to feel like work, and for most writers that is the smooch of death.
Writing is at its best—always, always, always—when it is a kind of inspired play for the writer. I can write in cold blood if I have to, but I like it best when it’s fresh and almost too hot to handle.*

**Add it as a joyful activity of your day. Like yoga, meditation or reading. 

---
Page: 146

*Still, I believe the first draft of a book—even a long one—should take no more than three months, the length of a season. Any longer and—for me, at least—the story begins to take on an odd foreign feel, like a dispatch from the Romanian Department of Public Affairs, or something broad-cast on high-band shortwave during a period of severe sunspot activity.*

**Everyday for three months to have your first draft for a long book. Has he ever had writers block?

---
Page: 146

*I like to get ten pages a day, which amounts to 2,000 words. That’s 180,000 words over a three-month span, a goodish length for a book—something in which the reader can get happily lost, if the tale is done well and stays fresh.
On some days those ten pages come easily; I’m up and out and doing errands by eleven-thirty in the morning, perky as a rat in liverwurst. More frequently, as I grow older, I find myself eating lunch at my desk and finishing the day’s work around one-thirty in the afternoon. Sometimes, when the words come hard, I’m still fiddling around at teatime. Either way is fine with me, but only under dire circumstances do I allow myself to shut down before I get my 2,000 words.*

**10 pages per day is incredible. 

---
Page: 149

*But you need the room, you need the door, and you need the determination to shut the door. You need a concrete goal, as well. The longer you keep to these basics, the easier the act of writing will become. Don’t wait for the muse. As I’ve said, he’s a hardheaded guy who’s not susceptible to a lot of creative flut-tering. This isn’t the Ouija board or the spirit-world we’re talk-ing about here, but just another job like laying pipe or driving long-haul trucks. Your job is to make sure the muse knows where you’re going to be every day from nine ’til noon or seven ’til three. If he does know, I assure you that sooner or later he’ll start showing up, chomping his cigar and making his magic.*

**Build up the habit slowly so you don't get discouraged and stop. By forming the habit you're priming your mind for getting ready at a set time. It's just one other way of removing the world so you can go the space where ideas jump around. It should not be a question whether you write your set amount of words that day. It's like brushing your teeth, you just do it.

---
Page: 150

*What are you going to write about?
And the equally big answer: Anything you damn well want.
Anything at all . . . as long as you tell the truth.*

**I have a faint idea of what telling your truth means but I'm eons away from mastery of it.

---
Page: 151

*if you enjoy romances, it’s natural for you to want to write romances of your own. There’s nothing wrong with writing any of these things. What would be very wrong, I think, is to turn away from what you know and like (or love, the way I loved those old ECs and black-and-white horror flicks) in favor of things you believe will impress your friends, relatives, and writing-circle colleagues. What’s equally wrong is the deliberate turning toward some genre or type of fiction in order to make money. It’s morally wonky, for one thing— the job of fiction is to find the truth inside the story’s web of lies, not to commit intellectual dishonesty in the hunt for the buck. Also, brothers and sisters, it doesn’t work.*

**Whatever it is that you love, that you think is cool, don't hesitate to imitate. That's the first truthful act you'll be doing. Do it for love. When you love something you'll be able to see infinitely deep into it.

---
Page: 151

*Wrapped within it, like the chewy stuff in the center of a Tootsie Pop, is the assumption that the writer controls the material instead of the other way around.* The writer who is serious and committed is inca-pable of sizing up story material the way an investor might size up various stock offerings, picking out the ones which seem likely to provide a good return. If it could indeed be done that way, every novel published would be a best-seller and the huge advances paid to a dozen or so “big-name writ-ers” would not exist (publishers would like that).*

**Maybe creative works of art are much different than products. Maybe it won't be possible to analyze your way to success. It's much more organic than that, it's much more based in non-objective search principles. Novelty seeking.

---
Page: 153

*Write what you like, then imbue it with life and make it unique by blending in your own personal knowledge of life, friendship, relationships, sex, and work. Especially work. Peo-ple love to read about work. God knows why, but they do. If you’re a plumber who enjoys science fiction, you might well consider a novel about a plumber aboard a starship or on an alien planet. Sound ludicrous? The late Clifford D. Simak wrote a novel called Cosmic Engineerswhich is close to just that.
And it’s a terrific read. What you need to remember is that there’s a difference between lecturing about what you know and using it to enrich the story. The latter is good. The former is not.*

**No matter the subject, people have certain truths embedded in their umanity that they like to explore through stories. That's why archetypes are felt so viscerally. I did not think people were interested in the weeds of work. Maybe it's because it's such a huge part of many people's lives. 

---
Page: 154

*What youknow makes you unique in some other way. Be brave. Map the enemy’s positions, come back, tell us all you know. And remember that plumbers in space is not such a bad setup for a story.*

**Even if people don't recognize themselves in the situation they can clearly tell if you're bullshitting or not. You can have a completely made up story that has a lot of truth in it. 

---
Page: 154

*And— here’s the good part—this is a world impossible not to believe.
Grisham has been there, spied out the land and the enemy positions, and brought back a full report. He told the truth of what he knew, and for that if nothing else*

**Be vigilant in catching yourself lying. 

---
Page: 157

*On the contrary, I want them to do things theirway. In some instances, the outcome is what I visualized. In most, however, it’s something I never expected. For a suspense novelist, this is a great thing.
I am, after all, not just the novel’s creator but its first reader.
And if I’mnot able to guess with any accuracy how the damned thing is going to turn out, even with my inside knowledge of coming events, I can be pretty sure of keeping the reader in a state of page-turning anxiety. And why worry about the ending anyway? Why be such a control freak?
Sooner or later every story comes out somewhere.*

**Is that why Stephen King endings are usually bad? Most real-life stories only have one natural end, that is death. If the book doesn't end with everyone dying, it'll be hard to end it organically.

*No matter how good you are, no matter how much expe-rience you have, it’s probably impossible to get the entire fos-sil out of the ground without a few breaks and losses. To get even mostof it, the shovel must give way to more delicate tools: airhose, palm-pick, perhaps even a toothbrush. Plot is a far bigger tool, the writer’s jackhammer. You can liberate a fossil from hard ground with a jackhammer, no argument there, but you know as well as I do that the jackhammer is going to break almost as much stuff as it liberates. It’s clumsy, mechanical, anticreative. Plot is, I think, the good writer’s last resort and the dullard’s first choice. The story which results from it is apt to feel artificial and labored.*

**Real-life is not driven by plot. Plotarmor doesn't exist for example.

*In my view, stories and novels consist of three parts: narra-tion, which moves the story from point A to point B and finally to point Z; description, which creates a sensory reality for the reader; and dialogue, which brings characters to life through their speech.*

**It starts with a situation and a group of flat characters. Through narration the characters are moved through the story and through dialogue we get to learn about the characters.

Page: 161

*A strong enough situation renders the whole question of plot moot, which is fine with me. The most interesting situ-ations can usually be expressed as a What-ifquestion:
What ifvampires invaded a small New England village?*

**What if, sets you up and then you let your imagination generate the rest of it.

*Paul Sheldon turned out to be a good deal more resourceful than I initially thought, and his efforts to play Scheherazade and save his life gave me a chance to say some things about the redemptive power of writing that I had long felt but never articulated.*

**He started out with a piece of truth he wanted to tell and then as he explored it he found deeper related truths.

*Each of the novels summarized above was smoothed out and detailed by the editorial process, of course, but most of the elements existed to begin with. “A movie should be there in rough cut,” the film editor Paul Hirsch once told me. The same is true of books. I think it’s rare that incoherence or dull storytelling can be solved by something so minor as a second draft.*

**This is opposite to the conventional wisdom of product development, where the only way to get good is to iterate.

*Narrate this without plotting—let the situation and that one unexpected inversion carry you along. I predict you will succeed swimmingly . . . if, that is, you are honest about how your characters speak and behave. Honesty in story-telling makes up for a great many stylistic faults*

**Finding honesty is what makes up raw talent, the stylistic improvements are just icing on the cake.

*Before taking her nap, Jane decides to have a cup of herbal tea and watch the news. (Can you use that pot of boiling water on the stove later on? Perhaps, perhaps.)*

**I love this way of dynamically generating the world based on the characters and the situation.

*As I’ve said, we’ve all heard someone say, “Man, it was so great (or so horrible/strange/funny) . . . I just can’t describe it!” If you want to be a successful writer, you mustbe able to describe it, and in a way that will cause your reader to prickle with recognition. If you can do this, you will be paid for your labors, and deservedly so. If you can’t, you’re going to collect a lot of rejection slips and perhaps explore a career in the fascinating world of telemarketing.*

**You have to be able to imagine things very vividly. The more details you have to go on the richer and the deeper your descriptions can be. Finding the best and most parsimonious descriptions require a great mind for analogies. 

---
Page: 166

*We all remember one or more high school losers, after all; if I describe mine, it freezes out yours, and I lose a little bit of the bond of understanding I want to forge between us. Description begins in the writer’s imagi-nation, but should finish in the reader’s.*

**Don't overdo it, then it becomes you ranting and pushing yourself onto the reader.

Page: 167

*So spare me, if you please, the hero’s sharply intelligent blue eyesand outthrust determined chin;likewise the heroine’s arrogant cheek-bones.This sort of thing is bad technique and lazy writing, the equivalent of all those tiresome adverbs.
For me, good description usually consists of a few well-chosen details that will stand for everything else. In most cases, these details will be the first ones that come to mind.
Certainly they will do for a start. If you decide later on that you’d like to change, add, or delete, you can do so—it’s what rewrite was invented for. But I think you will find that, in most cases, your first visualized details will be the truest and best. You should remember (and your reading will prove it over and over again should you begin to doubt) that it’s as easy to overdescribe as to underdescribe. Probably easier.*

**Make an honest description, not an overly verbose shower of back pats from the writer.

*Before beginning to write, I’ll take a moment to call up an image of the place, drawing from my memory and filling my mind’s eye, an eye whose vision grows sharper the more it is used. I call it a men-tal eye because that’s the phrase with which we’re all familiar, but what I actually want to do is open allmy senses. This memory search will be brief but intense, a kind of hypnotic recall. And, as with actual hypnosis, you’ll find it easier to accomplish the more you attempt it.*

**Imagination can be improved with training. Let's start painting rich scenarios where all senses are engaged. I should of course ease into it.

*This isn’t the Taj Mahal we’re visiting, after all, and I don’t want to sell you the place. It’s also important to remember it’s not about the setting, anyway—it’s about the story, and it’s alwaysabout the story. It will not behoove me (or you) to wander off into thickets of description just because it would be easy to do.*

**What is story? 

---
Page: 170

*The use of simile and other figurative language is one of the chief delights of fic-tion—reading it and writing it, as well. When it’s on target, a simile delights us in much the same way meeting an old friend in a crowd of strangers does. By comparing two seem-ingly unrelated objects—a restaurant bar and a cave, a mir-ror and a mirage—we are sometimes able to see an old thing in a new and vivid way.*

**Louis CK does this very well. You feel like you become smarter by having heard it.

Page: 172

*It’s dialogue that gives your cast their voices, and is crucial in defining their characters—only what people do tells us more about what they’re like, and talk is sneaky: what people say often conveys their character to oth-ers in ways of which they—the speakers—are completely unaware.
You can tell me via straight narration that your main char-acter, Mistuh Butts, never did well in school, never even went much to school, but you can convey the same thing, and much more vividly, by his speech . . . and one of the cardinal rules of good fiction is never tell us a thing if you can show us, instead:*

**It's hard to get it to sound organic, you really have to inhabit the person and act the way they would in the situation they're in. 

---
Page: 177

*Two guys at lunch in Beverly Hills, and right away we know they’re both players. They may be phonies (and maybe they’re not), but they’re an instant buy within the context of Leonard’s story; in fact, we welcome them with open arms.
Their talk is so real that part of what we feel is the guilty pleasure of anyone first tuning in and then eavesdropping on an interesting conversation. We’re getting a sense of charac-ter, as well, although only in faint strokes.*

**Dialogue teases out an image of the characters in the reader's mind. 

---
Page: 178

*You musttell the truth if your dialogue is to have the reso-nance and realism that Hart’s War,good story though it is, so sadly lacks—and that holds true all the way down to what folks say when they hit their thumb with the hammer. If you substitute “Oh sugar!” for “Oh shit!” because you’re think-ing about the Legion of Decency, you are breaking the unspoken contract that exists between writer and reader— your promise to express the truth of how people act and talk through the medium of a made-up story.*

**Truth is an important guiding light for being consistent. 

---
Page: 181

*Some people don’t want to hear the truth, of course, but that’s not your problem. What would be is wanting to be a writer without wanting to shoot straight. Talk, whether ugly or beautiful, is an index of character; it can also be a breath of cool, refreshing air in a room some people would prefer to keep shut up. In the end, the important question has nothing to do with whether the talk in your story is sacred or profane; the only question is how it rings on the page and in the ear. If you expect it to ring true, then you must talk yourself. Even more important, you must shut up and listen to others talk.*

**Life becomes richer when every action has more intent. Listen, really listen to how people talk and intuit what makes people talk the way they do and hone your ability to simulate their speech. 

---
Page: 182

*For me, what happens to characters as a story progresses depends solely on what I discover about them as I go along— how they grow, in other words. Sometimes they grow a little.
If they grow a lot, they begin to influence the course of the story instead of the other way around. I almost always start with something that’s situational. I don’t say that’s right, only that it’s the way I’ve always worked. If a story ends up that same way, however, I count it something of a failure no mat-ter how interesting it may be to me or to others. I think the best stories always end up being about the people rather than the event, which is to say character-driven. Once you get beyond the short story, though (two to four thousand words, let’s say), I’m not much of a believer in the so-called charac-ter study; I think that in the end, the story should always be the boss. Hey, if you want a character study, buy a biography or get season tickets to your local college’s theater-lab pro-ductions. You’ll get all the character you can stand.*

**What would the character do? The answer might surprise you. And remember each character is the main character in their own life. Inhabit that. The character's traits will be influenced by the creator's own, but that's fine. 

---
Page: 187

*My job (and yours, if you decide this is a viable approach to storytelling) is to make sure these fictional folks behave in ways that will both help the story and seem reasonable to us, given what we know about them (and what we know about real life, of course).
Sometimes villains feel self-doubt (as Greg Stillson does);
sometimes they feel pity (as Annie Wilkes does). And some-times the good guy tries to turn away from doing the right thing, as Johnny Smith does . . . as Jesus Christ himself did, if you think about that prayer (“take this cup from my lips”) in the Garden of Gethsemane. And if you do your job, your characters will come to life and start doing stuff on their own. I know that sounds a little creepy if you haven’t actually experienced it, but it’s terrific fun when it happens. And it will solve a lot of your problems, believe me.*

**Again, what is story?

*Symbolism doesn’t have to be difficult and relentlessly brainy. Nor does it have to be consciously crafted as a kind of ornamental Turkish rug upon which the furniture of the story stands. If you can go along with the concept of the story as a pre-existing thing, a fossil in the ground, then symbolism must also be pre-existing, right? Just another bone (or set of them) in your new discovery. That’s if it’s there. If it isn’t, so what? You’ve still got the story itself, don’t you?
If it isthere and if you notice it, I think you should bring it out as well as you can, polishing it until it shines and then cutting it the way a jeweler would cut a precious or semi-precious stone.*

**Symbolism comes after the story. My preconceived notion had been that the author starts with what they want to say and then build the story around it. 

---
Page: 192

*Does that make it necessary to the success of your story or novel? Indeed not, and it can actually hurt, especially if you get carried away. Symbolism exists to adorn and enrich, not to create a sense of artificial profundity. Noneof the bells and whistles are about story, all right? Only storyis about story.
(Are you tired of hearing that yet? I hope not, ’cause I’m not even closeto getting tired of saying it.) Symbolism (and the other adornments, too) doesserve a use-ful purpose, though—it’s more than just chrome on the grille.
It can serve as a focusing device for both you and your reader, helping to create a more unified and pleasing work. I think that, when you read your manuscript over (and when you talk it over), you’ll see if symbolism, or the potential for it, exists.
If it doesn’t, leave well enough alone. If it does, however—if it’s clearly a part of the fossil you’re working to unearth—go for it. Enhance it. You’re a monkey if you don’t.*

**If you find it, embrace it and polish it. If not, leave it out.

*There is absolutely no need to be hidebound and conser-vative in your work, just as you are under no obligation to write experimental, nonlinear prose because The Village Voice or The New York Review of Bookssays the novel is dead. Both the traditional and the modern are available to you. Shit, write upside down if you want to, or do it in Crayola pic-tographs. But no matter how you do it, there comes a point when you must judge what you’ve written and how well you wrote it. I don’t believe a story or a novel should be allowed outside the door of your study or writing room unless you feel confident that it’s reasonably reader-friendly.*

**Do whatever you want but do it in such a way that benefits the reader.

*Boredom can be a very good thing for someone in a cre-ative jam. I spent those walks being bored and thinking about my gigantic boondoggle of a manuscript.*

*There is no moralto The Stand,no “We’d betterlearn or we’ll probably destroy the whole damned planet next time”—but if the theme stands out clearly enough, those discussing it may offer their own morals and conclusions. Nothing wrong with that; such discussions are one of the great pleasures of the read-ing life.*

**The less of a lesson the book contains the more the reader can read into it.

*You undoubtedly have your own thoughts, interests, and concerns, and they have arisen, as mine have, from your experiences and adventures as a human being. Some are likely similar to those I’ve mentioned above and some are likely very different, but you have them, and you should use them in your work. That’s not all those ideas are there for, perhaps, but surely it’s one of the things they are good for.*

**This is the source of your own unique voice.

*Good fiction always begins with story and progresses to theme; it almost never begins with theme and progresses to story.*

**A story is something you can tell someone. The moral of the story is something you ascribe to what has already happened.

*If you’re a beginner, though, let me urge that you take your story through at least two drafts; the one you do with the study door closed and the one you do with it open.*

**I want to find someone who's willing to give me good feedback. 

---
Page: 201

*With the door shut, downloading what’s in my head directly to the page, I write as fast as I can and still remain comfortable. Writing fiction, especially a long work of fiction, can be a difficult, lonely job; it’s like crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a bathtub. There’s plenty of opportunity for self-doubt. If I write rapidly, putting down my story exactly as it comes into my mind, only looking back to check the names of my characters and the relevant parts of their back stories, I find that I can keep up with my original enthusiasm and at the same time outrun the self-doubt that’s always waiting to settle in.*

**Don't stand in the way of yourself. Find comfort in knowing that you'll come back a second time.

Page: 206

*Underneath, however, I’m asking myself the Big Ques-tions. The biggest: Is this story coherent? And if it is, what will turn coherence into a song? What are the recurring ele-ments? Do they entwine and make a theme? I’m asking myself What’s it all about, Stevie, in other words, and what I can do to make those underlying concerns even clearer.
What I want most of all is resonance,something that will linger for a little while in Constant Reader’s mind (and heart) after he or she has closed the book and put it up on the shelf.
I’m looking for ways to do that without spoon-feeding the reader or selling my birthright for a plot of message. Take all those messages and those morals and stick em where the sun don’t shine, all right? I want resonance. Most of all, I’m look-ing for what I meant,because in the second draft I’ll want to add scenes and incidents that reinforce that meaning. I’ll also want to delete stuff that goes in other directions. There’s apt to be a lot of that stuff, especially near the beginning of a story, when I have a tendency to flail. All that thrashing around has to go if I am to achieve anything like a unified effect. When I’ve finished reading and making all my little anal-retentive revisions, it’s time to open the door and show what I’ve written to four or five close friends who have indi-cated a willingness to look.*

**So after 6 weeks of rest, you come back to it and you start to look at the forest for the trees.

*Call that one person you write for Ideal Reader. He or she is going to be in your writing room all the time: in the flesh once you open the door and let the world back in to shine on the bubble of your dream, in spirit during the sometimes troubling and often exhilarating days of the first draft, when the door is closed. And you know what? You’ll find yourself bending the story even before Ideal Reader glimpses so much as the first sentence. I.R. will help you get outside yourself a little, to actually read your work in progress as an audience would while you’re still working. This is perhaps the best way of all to make sure you stick to story, a way of playing to the audience even while there’s no audience there and you’re totally in charge.*

**If you want readers to like what you do, you need to write for them in some sense. People rarely like the rants of narcissists.

*What the Formula taught me is that every story and novel is collapsible to some degree.
If you can’t get out ten per cent of it while retaining the basic story and flavor, you’re not trying very hard. The effect of judicious cutting is immediate and often amazing—literary Viagra. You’ll feel it and your I.R. will, too.*

**You harden the story, you make it tighter. 

---
Page: 216

*As a reader, I’m a lot more interested in what’s goingto happen than what already did.*

**Be parsimonious with back story. Keep it for yourself as a way of creating more depth for your characters. 

---
Page: 219

*The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting. Stick to the parts that are, and don’t get carried away with the rest. Long life stories are best received in bars, and only then an hour or so before closing time, and if you are buying.*

**Keep them short and relevant. Weave it in organically in little pieces. One Piece deals with back stories really well. The past comes haunting the character and it turns into a whole arc where more and more is revealed and eventually they're able to resolve their problems.

Page: 224

*In truth, I’ve found that any day’s routine interruptions and distractions don’t much hurt a work in progress and may actually help it in some ways. It is, after all, the dab of grit that seeps into an oyster’s shell that makes the pearl, not pearl-making seminars with other oysters. And the larger the work looms in my day—the more it seems like an I hafta instead of just an I wanna—the more problematic it can become. One serious problem with writers’ workshops is that I haftabecomes the rule.*

**Make it joyful, something you look forward to. Not a chore.

Page: 226

*You find yourself constantly questioning your prose and your purpose when what you should probably be doing is writing as fast as the Ginger-bread Man runs, getting that first draft down on paper while the shape of the fossil is still bright and clear in your mind.
Too many writing classes make Wait a minute, explain what you meant by thata kind of bylaw.*

**If you have to explain yourself all the time you'll be distracted. That's why you want to do the first draft behind closed doors.

Page: 228

*You don’t needwriting classes or seminars any more than you need this or any other book on writing. Faulkner learned his trade while working in the Oxford, Mississippi, post office. Other writers have learned the basics while serving in the Navy, working in steel mills, or doing time in America’s finer crossbar hotels. I learned the most valuable (and com-mercial) part of my life’s work while washing motel sheets and restaurant tablecloths at the New Franklin Laundry in Bangor. You learn best by reading a lot and writing a lot, and the most valuable lessons of all are the ones you teach your-self. These lessons almost always occur with the study door closed. Writing-class discussions can often be intellectually stimulating and great fun, but they also often stray far afield from the actual nuts-and-bolts business of writing.*

**You learn by putting in the hours and the hours are best spent on what you're trying to get good at. Anything else may just be for vanity points.

*I did it for the pure joy of the thing. And if you can do it for joy, you can do it forever.*

**Money is secondary, always.

*Writing isn’t about making money, getting famous, getting dates, getting laid, or making friends. In the end, it’s about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enriching your own life, as well. It’s about getting up, getting well, and getting over. Getting happy, okay? Getting happy.*

**Same applies for any creative pursuits.

Page: 260

*Some of this book—perhaps too much—has been about how I learned to do it. Much of it has been about how you can do it better. The rest of it—and perhaps the best of it—is a permission slip: you can, you should, and if you’re brave enough to start, you will.Writing is magic, as much the water of life as any other creative art. The water is free. So drink.
Drink and be filled up.*

**Creative confidence is a key enabler. You have to give yourself permission to do what you want. Not try, do.
