*When the Master governs, the people are hardly aware that he exists.
Next best is a leader who is loved.
Next, one who is feared.
The worst is one who is despised.
If you don’t trust the people, you make them untrustworthy.
The Master doesn’t talk, he acts.
When his work is done, the people say, ”Amazing:
we did it, all by ourselves!”*

**Seamless leadership requires that the leader has no ambition for fame. 

**What a surprisingly practical passage.

*Open yourself to the Tao, then trust your natural responses;
and everything will fall into place.*

**It's hard to detect whether you're holding on or not. Not trusting yourself is so easy, letting go is also easy. The less you try the easier it is. 

---

*If you want to accord with the Tao, just do your job, then let go.*

**It's quite clear when people are in accord with the Tao and when they're not. It's allows them to stretch their muscles to the fullest.

*Do you want to improve the world?
I don’t think it can be done.
The world is sacred.
It can’t be improved.
If you tamper with it, you’ll ruin it.
If you treat it like an object, you’ll lose it.
There is a time for being ahead, a time for being behind;
a time for being in motion, a time for being at rest;
a time for being vigorous, a time for being exhausted;
a time for being safe, a time for being in danger.
The Master sees things as they are, without trying to control them.
She lets them go their own way, and resides at the center of the circle.*

**Radical acceptance is like being in perfect balance. You cannot be moved, yet you can move yourself.

*All things end in the Tao as rivers f l ow into the sea.*

**Reminds me a bit of Mushishi where all life's energy is like rivers flowing in a very particular direction.

*Knowing others is intelligence;
knowing yourself is true wisdom.
Mastering others is strength;
mastering yourself is true power.
If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich.
If you stay in the center and embrace death with your whole heart, you will endure forever.*

**The fear of death increases the closer it gets. If you don't deal with it, you'll become less wise the older you get.

*Fame or integrity: which is more important?
Money or happiness: which is more valuable?
Success of failure: which is more destructive?
If you look to others for fulf i llment, you will never truly be fulf i lled.
If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself.
Be content with what you have;
rejoice in the way things are.
When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.*

**I have a pretty distinct picture of the kind of person who the world belongs to is. It's the Gokus and the Luffys of the world. Complete trust in the universe which the universe rewards by letting them play on with what they want.

*When a country is in harmony with the Tao, the factories make trucks and tractors.
When a country goes counter to the Tao, warheads are stockpiled outside the cities.
There is no greater illusion than fear, no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself, no greater misfortune than having an enemy.
Whoever can see through all fear will always be safe.*

**Reminds me of Thorfinn from Vinland Saga.

*The Master has no mind of her own.
She works with the mind of the people.
She is good to people who are good.
She is also good to people who aren’t good.
This is true goodness.
She trusts people who are trustworthy.
She also trusts people who aren’t trustworthy.
This is true trust.
The Master’s mind is like space.
People don’t understand her.
They look to her and wait.
She treats them like her own children.*

**Like water, it doesn't differentiate and it completely adapts to what's in contact with it.

*The Master gives himself up to whatever the moment brings.
He knows that he is going to die, and her has nothing left to hold on to:
no illusions in his mind, no resistances in his body.
He doesn’t think about his actions;
they f l ow from the core of his being.
He holds nothing back from life;
therefore he is ready for death, as a man is ready for sleep after a good day’s work.*

**How does one do this when there are scary people around?

---
Page: 55

*The Master’s power is like this.
He lets all things come and go effortlessly, without desire.
He never expects results;
thus he is never disappointed.
He is never disappointed;
thus his spirit never grows old.*

**Our minds growing old is different from our bodies growing old. It happens similarly with accumulated psychological scars.

*If you want to be a great leader, you must learn to follow the Tao.
Stop trying to control.
Let go of f i xed plans and concepts, and the world will govern itself.
The more prohibitions you have, the less virtuous people will be.
The more weapons you have, the less secure people will be.
The more subsidies you have, the less self-reliant people will be.
Therefore the Master says:
I let go of the law, and people become honest.
I let go of economics, and people become prosperous.
I let go of religion, and people become serene.
I let go of all desire for the common good, and the good becomes common as grass.*

**Thismis incredibly prescient. It's the definition of a leader-leader style of leadership. I wonder if they still think this way in China.

*If a country is governed with tolerance, the people are comfortable and honest.
If a country is governed with repression, the people are depressed and crafty.
When the will to power is in charge, the higher the ideals, the lower the results.
Try to make people happy, and you lay the groundwork for misery.
Try to make people moral, and you lay the groundwork for vice.
Thus the Master is content to serve as an example and not to impose her will.
She is pointed, but doesn’t pierce.
Straightforward, but supple.
Radiant, but easy on the eyes.*

**Imposing ideals on others will never let those ideals take root. They have to be nurtured from within by their own volition. 

---
Page: 59

*For governing a country well there is nothing better than moderation.
The mark of a moderate man is freedom from his own ideas.
Tolerant like the sky, all-pervading like sunlight, f i rm like a mountain, supple like a tree in the wind, he has no destination in view and makes use of anything life happens to bring his way.
Nothing is impossible for him.
Because he has let go, he can care for the people’s welfare as a mother cares for her child.*

**When you've let go you can let the task shape you without your own judgements clouding your actions.

*Governing a large country is like frying a small f i sh.
You spoil it with too much poking.
Center your country in the Tao and evil will have no power.
Not that it isn’t there, but you’ll be able to step out of its way.
Give evil nothing to oppose and it will disappear by itself.*

**Evil is a reactionary force, meaning it will perfectly swell up to the size of the force you put into it. It's a Chinese finger trap. 

---

*When a country obtains great power, it becomes like the sea:
all streams run downward into it.
The more powerful it grows, the greater the need for humility.
Humility means trusting the Tao, thus never needing to be defensive.*

**A recognition of winner takes all dynamics. 

---
Page: 61

*A great nation is like a great man:
When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.
Having realized it, he admits it.
Having admitted it, he corrects it.
He considers those who point out his faults as his most benevolent teachers.
He thinks of his enemy as the shadow that he himself casts.*

**Socratic honesty is the only road to virtue. 

---
Page: 63

*Act without doing;
work without effort.
Think of the small as large and the few as many.
Confront the diff i cult while it is still easy;
accomplish the great task by a series of small acts.
The Master never reaches for the great;
thus she achieves greatness.
When she runs into a diff i culty, she stops and gives herself to it.
She doesn’t cling to her own comfort;
thus problems are no problem for her.*

**Iterative and incremental development was apparently conceived hundreds of years ago. There's a nice added touch of tackling the hard problems first. 

---
Page: 64

*What is rooted is easy to nourish.
What is recent is easy to correct.
What is brittle is easy to break.
What is small is easy to scatter.
Prevent trouble before it arises.
Put things in order before they exist.
The giant pine tree grows from a tiny sprout.
The journey of a thousand miles starts from beneath your feet.
Rushing into action, you fail.
Trying to grasp things, you lose them.
Forcing a project to completion, you ruin what was almost ripe.
Therefore the Master takes action by letting things take their course.
He remains as calm at the end as at the beginning.
He has nothing, thus has nothing to lose.
What he desires is non-desire;
what he learns is to unlearn.
He simply reminds people of who they have always been.
He cares about nothing but the Tao.
Thus he can care for all things.*

**I've gotten way to unbalanced in my view of Kasta. I need to relax, stay centered, let what happens happen. I have nothing, and I have nothing to lose. I have no desire, nothing to prove to anyone.

*The ancient Masters didn’t try to educate the people, but kindly taught them to not-know.
When they think that they know the answers, people are diff i cult to guide.
When they know that they don’t know, people can f i nd their own way.
If you want to learn how to govern, avoid being clever or rich.
The simplest pattern is the clearest.
Content with an ordinary life, you can show all people the way back to their own true nature.*

**Ask the hard questions that gets people to move towards the necessary path.

Page: 66

*All streams f l ow to the sea because it is lower than they are.
Humility gives it its power.
If you want to govern the people, you must place yourself below them.
If you want to lead the people, you must learn how to follow them.
The Master is above the people, and no one feels oppressed.
She goes ahead of the people, and no one feels manipulated.
The whole world is grateful to her.
Because she competes with no one, no one can compete with her.*

**This idea of a leader is so refreshing. Especially compared to the stereotypical western leader, someone who's able to put people down and put pressure on them. 

**Leadership without the feeling of manipulation or oppression would be necessary to lead the best and the brightest for their mental capacity could not thrive under oppression.

*Some say that my teaching is nonsense.
Others call it lofty but impractical.
But to those who have looked inside themselves, this nonsense makes perfect sense.
And to those who put it into practice, this loftiness has roots that go deep.
I have just three things to teach:
simplicity, patience, compassion.
These three are your greatest treasures.
Simple in actions and in thoughts, you return to the source of being.
Patient with both friends and enemies, you accord with the way things are.
Compassionate toward yourself, you reconcile all beings in the world.*

**These three things are good but I don't get the sense that it's a complete list. 

---
Page: 70

*My teachings are easy to understand and easy to put into practice.
Yet your intellect will never grasp them, and if you try to practice them, you’ll fail.
My teachings are older than the world.
How can you grasp their meaning?
If you want to know me, look inside your heart.*

**Is this spoken as the Tao itself? 

---
Page: 71

*Not-knowing is true knowledge.
Presuming to know is a disease.
First realize that you are sick;
then you can move toward health.
The Master is her own physician.
She has healed herself of all knowing.
Thus she is truly whole.*

**Socrates would agree.

Page: 75

*When taxes are too high, people go hungry.
When the government is too intrusive, people lose their spirit.
Act for the people’s benef i t.
Trust them; leave them alone.*

**This is true for all types and sizes of groups. 

---
Page: 76

*Men are born soft and supple;
dead, they are stiff and hard.
Plats are born tender and pliant;
dead, they are brittle and dry.
Thus whoever is stiff and inf l exible is a disciple of death.
Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life.
The hard and stiff will be broken.
The soft and supple will prevail.*

**I wonder how general of a concept elasticity is. Anything turned more elastic is less sturdy but more resilient.

Page: 77

*As it acts in the world, the Tao is like the bending of a bow.
The top is bent downward;
the bottom is bent up.
It adjusts excess and def i ciency so that there is perfect balance.
It takes from what is too much and give to what isn’t enough.
Those who try to control, who use force to protect their power, go against the direction of the Tao.
They take from those who don’t have enough and give to those who have far too much.
The Master can keep giving because there is no end to her wealth.
She acts without expectation, succeeds without taking credit, and doesn’t think that she is better than anyone else.*

**Water divides itself, it flows to where there's room. The master is like an overflowing river with no end. 

---
Page: 79

*Failure is an opportunity.
If you blame someone else, there is no end to the blame.
Therefore the Master fulf i lls her own obligations and corrects her own mistakes.
She does what she needs to do and demands nothing of others.*

**This attitude has been very helpful for me. I would not have improved as much without it.

Page: 81

*True words aren’t eloquent;
eloquent words aren’t true.
Wise men don’t need to prove their point;
men who need to prove their point aren’t wise.
The Master has no possessions.
The more he does for others, the happier he is.
The more he gives to others, the wealthier he is.
The Tao nourishes by not forcing.
By not dominating, the Master leads.*

**The feeling of needing to prove your point stands out as the times you've been at your worst.
