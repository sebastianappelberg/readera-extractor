*The critical thing is to have a goal. To strive for something big and hard and important to you. Then every step you take toward that goal, even if it’s a stumble, moves you forward.
And you can’t skip a step—you can’t just have the answers handed to you and detour around the hard stuff. Humans learn through productive struggle, by trying it themselves and screwing up and doing it differently next time. In early adulthood you have to learn to embrace that—to know that the risks might not pan out but to take them anyway. You can get guidance and advice, you can choose a path by following someone else’s example, but you won’t really learn until you start walking down that path yourself and seeing where it takes you.*

**When does early adulthood end? How do you set goals that are worthy?

*Because this is it. This is your window. This is your time to take risks.
When you’re in your thirties and forties, the window begins to close for most people. Your decisions can no longer be entirely your own. That’s okay, too—great even—but it’s different. The people who depend on you will shape and influence your choices. Even if you don’t have a family to support, you’ll still accumulate just a little more each year—friends, assets, social standing—that you won’t want to risk.*

**The window for taking risks is closing rapidly.

*You might screw up. Your company might fail. You might have so many butterflies in your stomach you’ll be worried you got food poisoning. And that’s okay. It’s exactly what should be happening. If you don’t feel those butterflies then you’re not doing it right. You have to push yourself up the mountain, even if it means you might fall off a cliff.
I learned more from my first colossal failure than I ever did from my first success.*

**I'm definitely not pushing myself that hard. I'm in a situation where it feels like that will not end up benefitting me but someone else.

*But eventually a more experienced engineer got around to looking at what I’d coded and, baffled, asked why I’d built a network protocol that way. I answered that I didn’t know I was building a network protocol.
Mistake #2.
But even though I could have just read a book and saved myself days of work—man, did it feel good. I’d made something the world had never seen before, something useful, and I made it my way.*

**It's definitely useful to solve a problem from scratch with zero influence from prior work. It's how you get good at first principles thinking and creativity. 

---
Page: 25

*Let the scales tip a little on your work/life balance—let your passion for what you’re building drive you.*

**If you're going to push yourself as a builder you have to be building something you think is cool.

Page: 27

*After four years, I realized there was a whole world of thinking that was needed before a line of code should be written. And that thinking was fascinating. That thinking was what I wanted to do.
The enormous gut punch of our failure, of my failure, of everything I’d worked for falling apart—it made the path in front of me strangely clear:
General Magic was making incredible technology but wasn’t making a product that would solve real people’s problems.*

**If you want to have an impact, build something that solves a problem. That's also what I think is lacking where I am now. 

---
Page: 32

*You should know where you want to go, who you want to work with, what you want to learn, who you want to become. And from there, hopefully you’ll start to understand how to build what you want to build.*

**I'm in serious need of a vision quest. I know I have something I could die for, but I haven't bothered finding it within.

---
Page: 32

*If you’re passionate about something—something that could be solving a huge problem one day—then stick with it.
Look around and find the community of people who are passionate about it, too. If there’s nobody else on Earth thinking about it, then you may truly be too early or going in the wrong direction. But if you can find even a handful of like-minded people, even if it’s just a tiny community of geeks building technology nobody has any idea how to turn into a real business, then keep going.*

**This neatly summarizes what to do next when you've fallen in love with something. Honestly I don't think the popularity of what you want to do should play into the decision of whether to pursue it or not.

---
Page: 31

*To do great things, to really learn, you can’t shout suggestions from the rooftop then move on while someone else does the work. You have to get your hands dirty. You have to care about every step, lovingly craft every detail. You have to be there when it falls apart so you can put it back together.
You have to actually do the job. You have to love the job.
But what happens if you fall in love with the wrong thing? If you find a product or company that’s too early—the supporting infrastructure isn’t there, the customers don’t exist, the leadership has a crazy vision and won’t budge.*

**Whatever I choose to do I should be the leading authority on it. I should know it better than Einstein knew relativity. 

---
Page: 28

*Cool technology isn’t enough. A great team isn’t enough. Plenty of funding isn’t enough. Too many people throw themselves blindly at hot trends, anticipating a gold rush, and end up falling off a cliff. Look at the body count of virtual reality (VR)—dead startups as far as the eye can see and billions of dollars burned up over the past thirty years.
“If you make it, they will come” doesn’t always work. If the technology isn’t ready, they won’t come for sure. But even if you’ve got the tech, then you still have to time it right. The world has to be ready to want it.
Customers need to see that your product solves a real problem they have today—not one that they may have in some distant future.*

**What does it mean for the world to be ready? Can you nudge the world towards becoming ready? 

---
Page: 34

*And if you’re going to devote that much time to gathering information, then learn about something you’d be interested in even if you weren’t trying to get a job doing it. Follow your curiosity. Once you’re armed with that knowledge, then you can start hunting down the people who are the best of the best and trying to work with them. And that doesn’t mean stalking Elon Musk if you’re into electric cars. Look at who reports to him. And who reports to them. And which competing company would kill to hire those people. Understand the subdisciplines and see who leads the one you’re most interested in. Find the experts on Twitter or YouTube, then send them a message, a comment, a LinkedIn connection. You’re interested in the same things, you have the same passions—so share your point of view, ask a smart question, or just tell them about some fascinating minutiae that your family and friends find deeply, desperately, unfathomably boring.
Make a connection. That’s the best way to get a job anywhere.
And if that seems impossible—if you follow your heroes on Twitter but can’t imagine they’ll ever pay any attention to you—I’m excited to tell you that that is complete bullshit.*

**Don't let fear get in the way of connection. If you admire someone enough to want to learn from them, approach them and do it earnestly and be of use to them so they want to be of use to you. I want to meet Michael Levin.

*When you get a chance to work with legends and heroes and gods, you realize they’re none of the things that you’ve fabricated in your brain. They can be geniuses in one area and clueless in another. They can raise you up by praising your work, but you can also help them, catch things they miss, and build a relationship based not on starry-eyed hero worship but mutual respect.
And let me tell you, there is nothing in the world that feels better than helping your hero in a meaningful way and earning their trust—watching them realize you know what you’re talking about, that you can be relied on, that you’re someone to remember. And then seeing how that respect evolves as you move on to the next job, and the next.
That’s the great thing about heroes. You can use their inspiration to drive you. If you do it right, and listen carefully, they’ll share decades of learning. And then, one day, you might return the favor.*

**Proximity is destiny. The bright stars are bright for a reason, go take part of the energy they emit so that you may create something amazing.

*The most wonderful part of building something together with a team is that you’re walking side by side with other people. You’re all looking at your feet and scanning the horizon at the same time. Some people will see things you can’t, and you’ll see things that are invisible to everyone else. So don’t think doing the work just means locking yourself in a room—a huge part of it is walking with your team. The work is reaching your destination together. Or finding a new destination and bringing your team with you.*

**Looking up and looking around you is a great formulation of seeing the forest for the trees and adding two dimensions to it. Looking forward, meaning seeing if the goal is still in sight. Looking around, seeing if you're still aligned with your coworkers.

*General Magic’s target customer was “Joe Sixpack.” Seriously. It’s a derogatory caricature of an average American slumped on his couch, drinking beer, watching football, not thinking about much of anything. It’s a terrible way to imagine your customer. And even though we repeated it over and over, claimed we were doing it all for him—it was meaningless.
Because even if Joe Sixpack existed, he was never going to buy the Magic Link. This was before the internet was remotely accessible, at a time when most people didn’t have a desktop computer, didn’t have email, couldn’t imagine mobile games or movies.
It was 1992. Joe Sixpack had literally no reason to put a computer in his pocket.*

**It's funny how we're talking about the average Joe as our target audience. Is the world ready? Will they shrug their shoulders?

*Just like the specter of management. How do you manage a team when you’ve never managed before? How do you make decisions when everyone’s split on what to do? How do you set a process to make forward progress toward a unified goal? How do you know if you’re headed in the right direction? Or if you should quit?
The sooner you realize these questions exist, the better. Everyone rising in their career has to face them at some point.
And I’ll be honest: the first time you encounter them, you’ll probably screw up. Everyone does. That’s okay. You’ll learn and grow and get better.
But to make that first big leap into leadership less daunting, I’ve written up a few things that might help.*

**You'll screw up multiple times and the pain is what's going to push you to figure it out. 

---
Page: 55

*So you get deep into the weeds, deep into everyone’s work. And they’re doing all kinds of weird stuff—not how you would do it at all. And why is it taking so long? Doing their job well is how you got promoted, so now you’ll just show everyone how to do it right. You’ll tell them—step by step, detail by detail—how to be successful.
It doesn’t go well. The team doesn’t feel like you trust them. And since you’re stretched so thin, focusing on every detail of everyone else’s process, nobody really knows what they should be working on or what’s most important. People start complaining to you and about you. Everyone gets pissed off.
The more things go wrong, the more you fall back on doing what you know. And you know accounting. So instead of becoming a better accounting manager, you focus on being the best accountant on the team.
You start taking on more tasks that your team should be doing themselves.
You withhold your feedback and concerns because you don’t want to demoralize people further. You rally the team by crying, “We’ll get through this! I’ll show you how it’s done! Just watch and follow me!”
And that’s all it takes. That’s how normal, reasonable people turn into unbearable micromanagers. That’s how projects slow down and disintegrate for lack of leadership. That’s the hole that many people fall into when they’re put in charge of a team. And some never climb out of it.*

**I've done this so hard it's embarrassing, but I at least have some perspective on it now.

---
Page: 56

*Everyone was smart and could manage themselves.
So anyone who tried to be a real manager was pretty much ignored.
It was great. Until the team grew. Until we needed to launch something and turn all these brilliant minds in one direction. Until we all had to agree on what was necessary and what got cut.
So when I joined Philips after General Magic, I knew my team would need more structure, that there would have to be defined deadlines and a plan and clear leadership. I knew I’d have to be a manager.
No problem, I thought. I’m an engineer who’s going to tell other engineers how to do their jobs, right?
Enter the police light. The stress. And the frustration, for me and the team, the incessant questions and prodding. The micromanagement.
When you’re a manager, you’re no longer just responsible for the work.
You’re responsible for human beings. And while that seems obvious—yes, that’s the whole point of the job—it’s a difficult thing to grapple with when all of a sudden eighty people are looking at you, expecting you to know how to lead them.*

**Management has value, and management debt can be as devastating as technical debt.

---
Page: 58

*But I wanted to understand the squishy stuff and the geeky stuff. And I liked all of it. I could also translate back and forth—explain the squish to engineers, translate the 1s and 0s to the creatives. I could synthesize all the pieces and keep the whole company in my head.
For me, that was thrilling, exciting, inspiring. It was all I wanted to do.
And that meant being a manager. I was drawn to the work, but more importantly, the mission required it. The team needed it.*

**I'm also quite good at bridging between disciplines, though I'm less of a people person and more of a builder. 

---
Page: 58

*One of the hardest parts of management is letting go. Not doing the work yourself. You have to temper your fear that becoming more hands-off will cause the product to suffer or the project to fail. You have to trust your team—give them breathing room to be creative and opportunities to shine.
But you can’t overdo it—you can’t create so much space that you lose track of what’s going on or are surprised by what the product becomes. You can’t let it slide into mediocrity because you’re worried about seeming overbearing. Even if your hands aren’t on the product, they should still be on the wheel.*

**I've jumped between both extremes. I tried full micromanagement, unintentionally, and it didn't work. So I tried letting go completely and it didn't work. Focus on the outcome, create clarity in processes, define it upfront, let go and let the team do their thing, go in and adjust if the outcome is suffering.

*The other place where you’ll get useful data is in 1:1s with team members. It’s all too easy to turn 1:1s into friendly chats that go nowhere, so just as you need to have a process for your team meetings, your weekly meetings with individuals should have an agenda, a clear purpose, and should be beneficial to both sides. You should get the info you need about product development and your team members should get insight into how they’re doing. Try to see the situation from their point of view—talk about their fears and your own concerns out loud, reframe your thoughts so they can hear the feedback, understand the goals, clear up ambiguities or concerns.*

**I can definitely make my 1:1s more purposeful.

*Before I learned to create a little distance between what I felt and what I needed to express at work, I let too many of my worries and fears leak into my voice and into my daily interactions. Your team amplifies your mood, so when I was frustrated, those feelings rocketed around the office and came back tenfold. The more upset I got with our lack of progress, the more those frustrations infected the rest of the team. So I had to learn to modulate myself. To crank my personal style down a couple of notches to establish an effective management style.*

**I've felt this a little bit, but hearing it explicitly stated makes me recall that it's happened more than I thought. 

---
Page: 62

*So as a manager, you have to find what connects with your team. How can you share your passion with them, motivate them?
The answer, as usual, comes down to communication. You have to tell the team why. Why am I this passionate? Why is this mission meaningful?
Why is this small detail so important that I’m flipping out right now when nobody else seems to think it matters? Nobody wants to follow someone who throws themselves at windmills for no reason. To get people to join you, to truly become a team, to fill them with the same energy and drive that’s bubbling within you, you need to tell them the why.*

**Make people intrinsically motivated. Let them know they're doing what they do for a good reason. Always explain the why honestly. 

---
Page: 62

*And sometimes you need to supplement it with a little what. What am I getting paid? What will I be rewarded with if I succeed? Even if your team is all fired up about the mission, don’t forget about extrinsic motivation.
These are human beings. They may need a raise, a promotion, or even a party. A kind word. Figure out what makes them feel valued. Understand what makes them happy at work.*

**Extrinsic rewards are necessary too and people get motivated  by different things.

---
Page: 64

*If you’re a good manager and build a good team, that team will blast off. So lean into it. Cheer them on when they get promoted. Glow with pride when they kick ass at a board meeting or present their work to the entire company. That’s how you become a good manager. That’s how you start to love the job.*

**As a leader you should be measured by the outcomes your team is able to produce. Make them the best versions of themselves, remove any obstacles, present them with opportunities and let them thrive on their own.

*Storytelling is how you get people to take a leap of faith to do something new. It’s what all our big choices ultimately come down to— believing a story we tell ourselves or that someone else tells us. Creating a believable narrative that everyone can latch on to is critical to moving forward and making hard choices. It’s all that marketing comes down to.
It’s the heart of sales.
And right now you’re selling—your vision, your gut, your opinion.
So don’t just hit them with the classic “This is Jane, this is her life, and this is how her life changes when she uses our product” slide. Helping people see things from the customer’s perspective is a critical tool, but it’s just part of what you need to do. Your job in this moment is to craft a narrative that convinces leadership that your gut is trustworthy, that you’ve found all the data that could be gleaned, that you have a track record of good decisions, that you grasp the decision makers’ fears and are mitigating those risks, that you truly understand your customers and their needs and— most importantly—that what you’re proposing will have a positive impact on the business. If you tell that story well, if you bring people along with you on that journey, then they will follow your vision, even if there’s no hard data to back you up.*

**Storytelling is the best tool for making people understand something deeply without having experienced it themselves. Our imagination engines are that good. That means that if you tell a story that makes people agree with you at their core, they're more likely to understand you and follow you. Being able to tell a story also means that there's a coherent iceberg under the tip of it.

Page: 67

*So you have to design the options and the tests to really know what you’re testing. You have to think through what A and B are rather than let them be randomly assigned by an algorithm or thoughtlessly thrown against a wall to see what sticks. And that takes insight and knowledge of the entire customer journey. You need a hypothesis, and that hypothesis should be part of a bigger product vision. So you can A/B test where the “Buy” button should go on a Web page, whether it should be blue or orange, but you shouldn’t be testing whether or not a customer should buy online.
If you’re testing the core of your product, if the basic functionality can flex and change depending on the whims of an A/B test, then there is no core. There’s a hole where your product vision should be and you’re just shoveling data into the void.
In our case—and in the case of every first-generation product—we could have been shoveling forever. There was never going to be enough data to make an assured choice.
If a product is really new, there’s nothing to compare it to, nothing to optimize, nothing to test.*

**Data is usually very shallow, opinion and gut feeling is based on an integrated view of all the available data as well as everything that hasn't been possible to track and all the context and the vision of what could be. A purely data driven product has no richness and depth to it. 

---
Page: 73

*Plenty of people think I’m an asshole.
It’s usually because I get loud. I ask nicely a few times and then—if we’re still not getting anywhere—I stop asking nicely. I put pressure on myself and the people around me. I don’t let up. I expect the best—from myself, from everyone else. I care deeply about our mission, our team, our customers. I can’t stop myself from caring.
So I push. If something seems off, if I think there’s a chance we can do better, that the customer can get more, then I do not let up. I do not let things slide. [See also: Chapter 6.1: Becoming CEO.] I push people who are experts, who already know how it’s done, how it’s always been done, to find a new way to do it. And that’s a lot to take. It’s not easy to work with. I would never claim otherwise.
But pushing for greatness doesn’t make you an asshole. Not tolerating mediocrity doesn’t make you an asshole. Challenging assumptions doesn’t make you an asshole. Before dismissing someone as “just an asshole,” you need to understand their motivations.*

**These are just excuses for being an asshole. You can not tolerate mediocrity and still be easy to work with.

*Most people know in their gut when they should quit and then spend months—or years—talking themselves out of it. But I could tell from the start that I would have been well paid and utterly miserable.
And I want to make it very clear: hating your job is never worth the money.
I need to repeat that: hating your job is never worth whatever raise, title, or perks they throw at you to stay.*

**When you're working on something you're not passionate about, you are working for the money only. At that point it's time to quit.m

---
Page: 82

*Of course, as with everything, it helps to know the right people.
The key to finding them is networking. By that I don’t mean going to a conference and working the room, handing out your business cards or QR codes and cornering potential employers as they try to eat their stack of tiny sandwiches. I just mean make new relationships, beyond business—talk to people outside your bubble. Get to know what else is out there. Meet some new human beings. Networking is something you should be doing constantly—even when you’re happily employed.*

**How does one network well? Put yourself in places where you can meet new people and be charming I guess. 

---
Page: 82

*And don’t think of networking as a means to an end—as a tit-for-tat exchange where if you do someone a favor they may do you one in return.
Nobody wants to feel like they’re being used.
You should talk to people and make connections because you’re naturally curious. You want to know how other teams at your company work and what people do. You want to talk to your competitors because you’re all working to solve the same problems and they’re taking a different approach. You want your projects to be successful, so you don’t just talk to your immediate teammates at lunch—you grab lunch with your partners, your customers, their customers, their partners. You talk to everyone: get their ideas and their perspectives. In doing so you may be able to help someone or make a friend or strike up an interesting conversation.*

**Sharing a common interest with the people you network with makes the whole thing way easier. If you fall in love with something and there are other people who love it as well, it'll be really easy to talk to them. For some reason I haven't met that many people that I feel I can talk to.

---
Page: 83

*Once you find yourself in a place where you believe in the mission, everything changes.
Of course, you may need to quit that job, too. Because once you’re committed to a mission, to an idea—that’s the thing you should stick to.
The company is secondary. If you find something that inspires you, then follow the best opportunities to pursue it. I got hooked on personal electronics and followed that passion across five companies. It only became really lucrative at the very end, but it was what I loved to do, so I kept finding new opportunities to do it. Each job took a different angle, a new perspective on the same problem, and eventually I had a rich, 360-degree view of the challenge I wanted to solve and all the possible solutions. The idea was much more precious than the company signing my paychecks.*

**When you find your own why, the reason for your existence then everything will become a lot easier. You're the CEO of your own mission, you're doing something you believe in and as such your values and what you're doing will be aligned. 

---
Page: 85

*And remember that even if leadership acknowledges that you’re right and promises a major shift, it may take a while for anything to change. Or it may never change. But it’s worth it to try. Quitting anytime things get tough not only doesn’t look great on your résumé, but it also kills any chance you have of making something you’re proud of. Good things take time. Big things take longer. If you flit from project to project, company to company, you’ll never have the vital experience of starting and finishing something meaningful.
Jobs are not interchangeable. Work is not just a sweater you can take off when things get hot. Too many people jump ship the second they need to dig in and really push through the hard, grinding work of making something real. And when you look at their résumés you can instantly see the pattern.*

**This is what's holding me back. I want to not leave it a mess, I want to make it a success and then leave. It's vanity but it's what I feel.

*Philips could see that, but they couldn’t capitalize on it. They got elbow deep in Microsoft, building a PC with delusions of being a stereo. They were focused on what they could make, not why anyone would want it. I looked it over and thought: No. Nonono. You can’t use Windows—I’d been bashing my skull against a Microsoft OS for years and knew it was a dead end for consumer electronics. Who wants to wait two minutes for their TV to boot up? And you had to simplify the home theater for nongeeks. Make something that anyone could just plug and play.
I wanted to build one component that would hook up to the internet, but wouldn’t look or feel like a computer. Fuse was going to give people a consumer electronics experience: you’d be able to configure and order a whole home theater, including a CD/DVD player that would save your music to a built-in hard drive. Then you’d connect to the world’s first online store to download more songs, and one day, movies and TV shows. TiVo was all the rage then but I wanted Fuse to go further.*

**Having a clear vision in your minds eye of how people would interact with your invention is very important for creating something great. When you have that vision, you have a Northstar and moving towards it is much easier than riding around in the dark.

*I spent nine years at Apple. It’s the place where I finally grew up. I wasn’t just managing a team anymore. I was leading hundreds, thousands of people. It was a profound shift in my career and in who I was.
After a decade of failure, I finally made something—actually two things —that people actually wanted. I finally got it right.
But it didn’t feel like success at first. Or even in the end. It was still work, every step of the way.
Apple is where I learned where to draw the line—is it done enough? Is it good enough?
It’s where I learned the real meaning of design.
And it’s where I learned to organize my brain and my team in the face of intense, grinding, never-ending pressure.
So if you’re headed into a new phase of your career, navigating at higher and higher levels, building teams, building relationships, trying to find your footing further and further away from the actual thing you’re making but responsible for so much more than before, stressed out beyond belief, then I’m here to share what I’ve learned.*

**Being able to perform under pressure is needed to be at the top.

*On October 23, 2001—ten months from when I started—the iPod emerged into the world, our fat plastic-and-stainless-steel baby.*

**10 months is just incredible. Though everything that he'd been doing before had led up to this.

*People often get excited about making something with atoms—they dig into the design, interface, colors, materials, textures—and instantly become blind to simpler, easier solutions. But making anything with atoms is incredibly difficult—it’s not an app that you can copy and update with a click. The only time hardware is worth the headache of manufacturing and packaging and shipping is if it’s critically necessary and transformative. If hardware doesn’t absolutely need to exist to enable the overall experience, then it should not exist.
Of course, sometimes you do need hardware—it can’t be avoided. But when that happens, I still tell people to put it away. I say, “Don’t tell me what’s so special about this object. Tell me what’s different about the customer journey.”
Your product isn’t only your product.
It’s the whole user experience—a chain that begins when someone learns about your brand for the first time and ends when your product disappears from their life, returned or thrown away, sold to a friend or deleted in a burst of electrons.*

**Don't make everything into a nail just because you like your hammer. Think about the truth of the user's perceived problem or opportunity. In reality what would be the best way to solve it?

---
Page: 100

*Your product, marketing, and support have to grease the skids— continually communicate and connect with customers, give them the answers they need, so they feel like they’re on a smooth ride, a single continuous, inevitable journey.
To do that right, you have to prototype the whole experience—give every part the weight and reality of a physical object. Regardless of whether your product is made of atoms or bits or both, the process is the same. Draw pictures. Make models. Pin mood boards. Sketch out the bones of the process in rough wireframes. Write imaginary press releases. Create detailed mock-ups that show how a customer would travel from an ad to the website to the app and what information they would see at each touchpoint.
Write up the reactions you’d want to get from early adopters, the headlines you’d want to see from reviewers, the feelings you want to evoke in everyone. Make it visible. Physical. Get it out of your head and onto something you can touch. And don’t wait until your product is done to get started—map out the whole journey as you map out what your product will do.*

**Think holistically about the experience your putting together for the user. You should understand every part of their journey, map it out before starting anything, prototype it, refine it, and make it awesome. I think this is a good way to determine whether you have a viable business or not. It let's you see much more clearly whether the world is ready for what you're making since you're essentially simulating how a present day person would interact with your whole offering.

*But they didn’t understand that it wasn’t a straight COGS line item. It was a marketing expense. And a support expense. That screwdriver saved us so much money on phone support. Instead of angry calls, we had happy customers raving online about their great experience.*

**Sometimes you won't be able to justify something based on pure economics, you have to base it on your values. 

---

*But to prototype this moment properly—to truly understand the half second when someone notices the packaging and leans forward to pick it up —you can’t just call this theoretical person “someone.”
We had to know them. Who were they? Why would they pick up the box? What would they want to know? What was most important to them?
We took everything we’d learned about the industry and Nest’s potential customers, about demographics and psychographics, and we created two distinct personas. One was a woman and the other a man. The man was into technology, loved his iPhone, was always looking for cool new gadgets.
The woman was the decider—she dictated what made it into the house and what got returned. She loved beautiful things, too, but was skeptical of super-new, untested technology.
We gave them names and faces. We made a mood board of their home, their kids, their interests, their jobs. We knew what brands they loved and what drove them crazy about their house and how much money they spent on heating bills in the winter.
We needed to look through their eyes to understand why the man might pick up the box. And so we could convince the woman to keep it.
Over time we added more personas—couples, families, roommates—as we better understood our customers. But in the beginning we started with two—two human beings who everyone could imagine, whose photos they could touch.
That’s how prototyping works. It’s how you make abstract concepts into physical representations. You turn your messaging architecture into words and pictures on a box. [See also: Figure 5.4.1, in Chapter 5.4.] You turn “someone in a store” into Beth from Pennsylvania.
And then you keep going. Every step of the way, along every link of the chain.*

**This reminds me of how to create characters in writing. The better you do this, the richer the story is. It's a level of detail that separates the great from the good.

*When a company gives that kind of care and attention to every part of the journey, people notice. Our product was good, but ultimately it was the whole journey that defined our brand. That’s what made Nest special. It’s what makes Apple special. It’s what allows businesses to reach beyond their product and create a connection—not with users and consumers, but with human beings. It’s how you create something that people will love.*

**Companies are competing at both the product level but also customer journey level. A company may have a better product but still be beaten. Nokia versus Ericsson comes to mind. The ability to change shells made the Nokia phones feel like a way you could show off your personality.

*It never felt like a speech. It felt like a conversation. Like a story.
And the reason is simple: Steve didn’t just read a script for the presentation. He’d been telling a version of that same story every single day for months and months during development—to us, to his friends, his family. He was constantly working on it, refining it. Every time he’d get a puzzled look or a request for clarification from his unwitting early audience, he’d sand it down, tweak it slightly, until it was perfectly polished.
It was the story of the product. And it drove what we built.
If part of the story didn’t work, then part of the product wasn’t going to work, either, and would need to be changed.*

**He iterated on the vision and the why by working on a good story. How can you tell if a story is good? By the reactions you get when you tell it to people. The vision is the foundation, it's the ultimate goal. If it isn't compelling to people, you're probably doing it wrong. I don't think you should mistake this for avoiding contrarian ideas, rather it's a way of confirming contrarian ideas. The people who think it's contrarian are usually competitors, not future users.

*When you get wrapped up in the “what,” you get ahead of people. You think everyone can see what you see. But they don’t. They haven’t been working on it for weeks, months, years. So you need to pause and clearly articulate the “why” before you can convince anyone to care about the “what.”*

**It's so easy to get blind to the why when you're working on the what. You lose sight of the bigger picture. 

---
Page: 113

*Quick stories are easy to remember. And, more importantly, easy to repeat. Someone else telling your story will always reach more people and do more to convince them to buy your product than any amount of talking you do about yourself on your own platforms. You should always be striving to tell a story so good that it stops being yours—so your customer learns it, loves it, internalizes it, owns it. And tells it to everyone they know.*

**Intuitively this makes sense. That's why so many people use Uber for X as a way of telling their story. Although I think you should strive for something that doesn't leak the mindspace to some other company. 

---
Page: 112

*There’s an art to telling a compelling story. But there’s also a science.
And always remember that your customers’ brains don’t always work like yours. Sometimes your rational argument will make an emotional connection. Sometimes your emotional story will give people the rational ammunition to buy your product. Certain Nest customers looked at the beautiful thermostat that we lovingly crafted to appeal to their heart and soul and said, “Sure, okay. It’s pretty” and then had a thrilled, emotional reaction to the potential of saving twenty-three dollars on their energy bill.
Every person is different. And everyone will read your story differently.
That’s why analogies can be such a useful tool in storytelling. They create a shorthand for complicated concepts—a bridge directly to a common experience.
That’s another thing I learned from Steve Jobs. He’d always say that analogies give customers superpowers. A great analogy allows a customer to instantly grasp a difficult feature and then describe that feature to others.
That’s why “1,000 songs in your pocket” was so powerful. Everyone had CDs and tapes in bulky players that only let you listen to 10–15 songs, one album at a time. So “1,000 songs in your pocket” was an incredible contrast —it let people visualize this intangible thing—all the music they loved all together in one place, easy to find, easy to hold—and gave them a way to tell their friends and family why this new iPod thing was so cool.*

**Connect with your customers rationally and emotionally. Use analogies to make it simpler to understand. Understand their point of view completely and move them somehow. Iterate your story with your target audience.

*If you’re going to pour your heart into creating something new, then that thing should be disruptive. It should be bold. It should change something. It doesn’t have to be a product—Amazon was a disruptive service long before they got into making their own hardware. You can disrupt how things are sold, delivered, serviced, financed. You can disrupt how they’re marketed or recycled.
Disruption should be important for you personally—who doesn’t want to do something exciting and meaningful?—but it’s also important for the health of your business. If you’ve truly made something disruptive, your competition probably won’t be able to replicate it quickly.
The key is to find the right balance—not so disruptive that you won’t be able to execute, not so easy to execute that nobody will care. You have to choose your battles.
Just make sure you have battles.*

**Creativity is in bringing forth something the world has never seen. It might be an old thing in a new context, the novelty in the totality of it is what matters. 

---
Page: 116

*If your company is disruptive, you have to be prepared for strong reactions and stronger emotions. Some people will absolutely love what you’ve made. Some people will violently, relentlessly hate it. That’s the danger with disruption. It is not welcome by everyone. Disruption makes enemies.*

**Predict who your haters are going to be and have a strategy for mitigating their shit.

Page: 118

*The more we evolved, the more we wanted to change. At one point we came to Steve with radically new designs that we were really excited about —they were smaller and lighter, innovative and beautiful. And we’d removed the click wheel. He looked at them and said, “They’re great. But you’ve lost what it means to be an iPod.”
The world saw the click wheel and thought “iPod.” So removing it wasn’t an evolution—it was a disruption that made no sense at that moment. If we’d followed through we’d have made a smaller, lighter music player and diminished our own brand.*

**A team that is so good they've outpaced the world around them.

---
Page: 120

*But we decided to eat our own. We had to make the iPhone, even though we knew it could, probably would, kill the iPod.
It was an enormous risk. But with any disruption, the competition only wallows in Denial and Anger for so long. Eventually they reach Acceptance, and if they’ve got any life left in them, they’ll start working furiously to catch up to you. Or you may inspire a whole new wave of companies who can use your initial disruption as a stepping-stone to leapfrog you.
When you can see the competition nipping at your heels, you have to do something new. You have to fundamentally change who you are as a business. You have to keep moving.
You cannot be afraid to disrupt the thing that made you successful in the first place. Even if it made you hugely successful.*

**Be honest about where you see the world moving and get there before everyone else. Actually trying your best to observe where the world is headed is a good exercise. 

---
Page: 121

*Most people stall out at the first step—the first disruption. It’s easy to say “change something meaningful,” and infinitely harder to come up with a great idea and execute it in a way that connects with customers. [See also:
Chapter 4.1: How to Spot a Great Idea.] Especially because one amazing disruption may not be enough. You may have to disrupt things you never even thought of.*

**You need to look at the holistic experience of the users in the industry. 

---
Page: 122

*If you do it right, one disruption will fuel the next. One revolution will domino into another. People will laugh at you and tell you it’s ludicrous, but that just means they’re starting to pay attention. You’ve found something worth doing. Keep doing it.*

**It's ridiculous to them because they think what you're doing is too hard and that's why they haven't done it themselves. 

---
Page: 123

*1. Vision: Know what you want to make, why you’re making it, who it’s for, and why people will buy it. You’ll need a strong leader or a small group to ensure the vision is delivered intact.*

**I think it's rare to be disruptive without this. Although by non-objective search principles you don't necessarily need a goal to find novelty. Though I don't think they're mutually exclusive but rather that they should be combined. You wander aimlessly following what's novel and interesting until you stumble upon something that triggers a vision of the future. When that vision has popped up, you make it your goal and you pursue it.

*After weeks and weeks of argument, Steve put his foot down. There was no data that would definitively prove it would work. There was no data that would prove it wouldn’t. This was an opinion-driven decision and Steve’s opinion was the one that counted most. “So either get on board right now or you’re off the team,” Steve said. That settled it for marketing.
Of course, in the end Steve was proven right. The iPhone changed everything. And it was only possible because he stuck to his vision.*

**Even passionate people don't have an issue with a dictators veto if they know that it's an opinion driven decision at its core. 

---
Page: 130

*Forcing Steve to abandon his original plan was almost impossible. But we waged an all-out war trying to prove to him that this wasn’t an opinion-driven decision anymore. This was data. We were in V2. We had real revenue and insights from actual paying customers (although not enough of either).
We were iterating. We were climbing the mountain again. It was time to put the vision third.*

**And just the same, the dictator has to step aside when the data is clear.

---
Page: 132

*When you write a press release you say, “Here. This. This is what’s newsworthy. This is what really matters.”
So spend some time developing as great a press release as you can.
Consult with marketing and PR people if you have to. They’ll help you trim it down to the essentials.
Then weeks or months or years later, as you’re getting close to finishing, as you’re debating what makes it in, what gets cut, what matters, what doesn’t—take out your press release. Read it.
If you launched right now, could you more or less send that press release into the world and have it be mostly true? If the answer is yes, then congratulations: your product is probably ready, or at least pretty close. You have achieved the core of your vision. Everything else is most likely a “nice to have,” not a priority.
Of course, there’s a chance that since you started, you’ve had to pivot so much that the original press release is laughably off-base. Sometimes that happens.
No problem. Write another press release. Rinse. Repeat.*

**Focusing and prioritizing is a constant chatter and it feels like we're doing it in a void, not in a principled way. We're missing a vision of the final outcome. If we had that we would more easily be able to anchor our thoughts about priorities in something. 

---
Page: 130

*The lesson is about when and how vision and data should guide your decisions. In the very beginning, before there are customers, vision is more important than pretty much anything else.
But you don’t have to figure out your vision all by yourself. In fact, you probably shouldn’t. Locking yourself alone in a room to create a manifesto of your single, luminous vision looks and feels indistinguishable from completely losing your mind. Get at least one person—but preferably a small group—to bounce ideas off of. Sketch out your mission together.
Then fulfill it together.
In the end, you may create something magical and world-changing. But then again, you might not.
There’s always a chance that you valiantly clung to your vision for 1.0 in the face of all obstacles and the vision turned out to be wrong. [See also:
Chapter 3.6: Three Generations: The “chasm” is the hole companies can fall into.] Whatever you made just doesn’t work. Maybe there was a data-driven decision that you thought was an opinion. Maybe you just calculated wrong or timed it wrong or something changed in the macro environment that you couldn’t control.
At that point you have to go back and, as painful as it is, honestly and thoroughly analyze why you failed. This is the moment when you need to gather data. Your gut got you to this point, so find data to help you understand why your gut was wrong.*

**Getting a group together and collaboratively bring forth a vision sounds really fun. It's when work is not work anymore. 

---
Page: 132

*Typically your vision is so much greater than what materializes in V1.
There’s always another revision, always something else you want to do, change, add, tweak. When do you tear yourself away from what you’re making and just . . . stop? Ship it. Set it free. See what happens.*

**There are certain areas that I can generate grand visions in more than other areas. I think that's a sign that my interest in it is deeper.

*Heartbeats shouldn’t be too fast. If a team is constantly updating their product, then customers start tuning out. They don’t have time to learn how the product works—certainly not to master it—before suddenly it’s new again.
Look at Google. Its heartbeat is erratic, unpredictable. It works for them —mostly, sometimes—but it could work so much better. Google arguably only has one big external heartbeat each year at Google I/O—and most teams don’t bother aligning with it. They typically launch whatever they want whenever they want throughout the year, sometimes with real marketing behind it, other times with simple email campaigns.
That means they can never communicate with their customers in a cohesive way about their entire organization. One team does this, another does that, their announcements either overlap or ignore obvious opportunities to create a narrative. And nobody, not customers, not even employees, can keep up.
You need natural pauses so people can catch up to you—so customers and reviewers can give you feedback that you can then integrate into the next version. And so your team can understand what the customer doesn’t.
But you also can’t slow down too much. The heartbeats of companies that work with atoms rather than electrons are often way too slow. Because atoms are scary: you can’t relaunch an atom.
The right process and timing is a balancing act—not too fast, not too slow.*

**I've been of the same mindset as Google, just ship things as fast as possible. That doesn't take into consideration the greater picture, and the greater picture involves not just your deployment metrics but your uses and the world's own rhythms. Find your spot in the symphony of the world.

*Whenever the product would shift and evolve, we’d scramble. We’d have to harass everybody to tell us how many half days it would take them to deal with the change, instead of just dealing with it. We’d spend hours every week to “work the schedule” with each member of the team instead of actually working.
After a few months, we scrapped the whole system. No more half days.
We organized our time into bigger chunks—weeks, months. We started taking a macro view of our projects. And that enabled us to build the V1 of Velo in about eighteen months. Then we handed it, gleaming and new, to sales and marketing.
And they had absolutely no idea what to do with it. They’d never seen it before. They didn’t know how to sell it, where to sell it, how to advertise it.
They had been an afterthought to us, and now we were an afterthought to them.
We had figured out our internal heartbeat, but had never synced it with any other team. Nobody else could keep up with our rhythm. We were dancing to our own beat, sure that all eyes were on us, and our dance partner was across the room getting punch, thinking about electric shavers.
We needed internal milestones within the project—regular check-ins where we would make sure everybody understood how the product had evolved and could evolve their side of the business along with it. And to make sure the product still made sense. To see if marketing still liked it. To see if sales still liked it. To see if support could still explain it. To make sure everyone knew what they were making and the plan to launch it.
Those milestones slow you down in the short term, but ultimately speed up all of product development. And they make for a better product.
And then, eventually, finally, one day you’ll be done. Or at least done enough. And you’ll reach your very first external heartbeat for V1.*

**Find your rhythm and involve the whole company in it. It creates predictability without any estimations. 

---
Page: 144

*The reason it takes so long to reach gross margins and even longer to make net margins is that learning takes time. For your company and your customers.
Your team will have to figure out how to find product/market fit for V1, then get the product fixed up and properly marketed to a wider audience with V2, and only then can you focus on optimizing the business so it can be sustainable and profitable with V3.
And customers need time to feel you out. The vast majority of people aren’t early adopters —they won’t try new things right away. They need time to get used to the idea, time to read some reviews, time to ask their friends, and then time to wait until the next version comes out because that’ll probably be even cooler.*

**Set up your business to expect these three phases from the beginning. Each different phase will shift what's important. 

---
Page: 150

*No matter what you’re building, reaching profitability will take longer than you think. You will almost certainly not make any money with V1.
You’ll need to reinvent yourself at least three times. Sometimes many more.
And even if your timeline has shrunk—even if you’re just revving an app—your product still has to learn how to crawl, and then walk, before it can run. That can take just as long for an app or service as it does for a hardware launch. It takes time to evolve and change, to react to customer feedback, to make every point on the customer journey as strong as the product itself. And customers still need time to learn about you, to try your product, to decide it’s worth it. They need time to march up the adoption curve.*

**You have to die and be reborn over and over again until you've accumulated enough battle scars that you'll be able to navigate the market expertly. 

---
Page: 151

*Having that kind of laser focus on a few key differentiating elements is a much likelier way to reach your goals than throwing out a wide net and hoping for the best.*

**Throwing spaghetti on the wall to see what sticks is a naive approach. Use vision, focus and iteration.

*So when we started work on the Nest Protect smoke and CO alarm, our second product, you’d think it would be easier. That everything we’d built already would let us skip a few steps. But the second you start a new product, you have to hit the restart button—even if you’re at a big company.
Sometimes it’s even harder the second time around because all the infrastructure that’s been built up for the first product gets in the way. So you’ll still need to go through at least three generations before you get it right.
You make the product. You fix the product. You build the business.
You make the product. You fix the product. You build the business.
You make the product. You fix the product. You build the business.
Every product. Every company. Every time.*

**Make, fix, build the business. There's so much to optimize when it comes to your business, all costs, all channels, all partnerships, and so on.

*1. It solves for “why.” Long before you figure out what a product will do, you need to understand why people will want it. The “why” drives the “what.” [See also: Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.] 2. It solves a problem that a lot of people have in their daily lives.
3. It follows you around. Even after you research and learn about it and try it out and realize how hard it’ll be to get it right, you can’t stop thinking about it.*

**Use this checklist against the ideas that I have. What's important as well to even get started is to commit to looking for ideas. If you just try to find a good idea you won't, you need to say to yourself that you're going to find it.

*And my life was changing, too. I quit Apple and began traveling the world with my family. And in every hotel room, every house, every country, every continent—every thermostat sucked. We were too hot, or too cold, or just couldn’t figure out how to use them. The entire world had the same problem—this forgotten, unloved product that everyone had to have in their home was costing people tons of money on their bills and wasting untold amounts of energy while the planet just kept warming.*

**It's quite clear that he has obsessed over the problem. I think that's the most important thing to go deeper than you thought you could, to become the best version of yourself and to make that corner of the universe beautiful.

*So I let the idea catch me. I came back to Silicon Valley and got to work. I researched the technology, then the opportunity, the business, the competition, the people, the financing, the history. If I was going to upend my life and my family, take a huge risk, dedicate five to ten years to creating a device unlike anything I’d ever made in a space I knew nothing about, then I needed to give myself time to learn. I needed to sketch out designs. I needed to plan out features and think about the sales and business model.*

**You can have something pretty solid before actually starting the company. Carmack called this the larvae phase.

*The potential company-destroying problems—and the steps to mitigate them—went on and on. But listing them out, breaking them down, talking honestly about them, that’s what ultimately convinced investors that we really knew what we were getting into. And that we could make it work.
Eventually, each of those risks became a rallying cry for the team— instead of avoiding them, we embraced them. We continually said to ourselves, “If it were easy, everyone else would be doing it!” We were innovating. The risks and our ability to solve for them was what set us apart. We would do something nobody else thought possible.*

**We don't talk about risks at all at kasta and when I do bring it up I get nothing in response. Am I the one doing it wrong? The problem is that nobody else ever brings it up.

---
Page: 168

*But the only way to know if they’re truly great—meaningful, disruptive, important, worth your time—is to learn enough about them to see their huge potential risks, the vast downsides, the icy blue Titanic-sized shitshow that lurks just below the surface. At that point you’ll probably set that idea aside. You’ll move on to other opportunities, other jobs and journeys. Until you realize that no matter what you do, you can’t stop thinking about that one idea. That’s when you stop running from it and start chipping away at the risks, one by one, until you’re confident enough that they’re worth taking.
If that does not happen, then it’s not a great idea. It’s a distraction. Keep going until you find an idea that won’t let you go.**

**Be mindful of what problems get you going, pick one of them, play around with solutions and start scratching deeper.

*You’re going to need a mentor or a coach.
You’re going to need an incredible founding team.
And you’ll probably need a cofounder.*

**I agree with the first two but not the third. I really want to be able to find a good mentor, and a truly skilled team. 

---
Page: 175

*You can make do without a cofounder. You can survive for a while without a team. But you can’t make it without a mentor.
Find at least one person who you deeply trust and who believes in you.
Not a life coach or an executive leadership consultant, not an agency, not someone who’s read a lot of case studies and is ready to charge you by the hour. And not your parents—they love you too much to be impartial. Find an operational, smart, useful mentor who has done it before, who likes you and wants to help.*

**I need to get out and start meeting people.

*If they’ve never been on a small team starting from scratch, they’re often a fish out of water. They spend too much money too fast. Hire too many people. Don’t put in the time, don’t have the startup mentality, can’t make hard decisions, are buried by consensus thinking. They end up making mediocre products or nothing at all.*

**People can't really be this bad? It's the hard things that should trip people up. Things like, knowing how to hire outside your own competency, how to lead, how to build great products, etc.

Page: 188

*You can only have one customer. The bulk of your focus and the whole of your branding should be for consumers or business—not both.
Understanding your customer—their demographics and psychographics, their wants and needs and pain points—is the foundation of your company. Your product, team, culture, sales, marketing, support, pricing—everything is shaped by that understanding.
For the vast majority of businesses, losing sight of the main customer you’re building for is the beginning of the end.*

**Without a specific person in mind, who are you solving the problem for? It's important if you want to sell something. 

---
Page: 191

*When attention and focus shift away from the consumer and toward the businesses bringing in the real money, companies go down some very dark alleys.
And it’s always the consumers who suffer.
So do not lose your focus. Do not think you can serve two masters. No matter what you’re building, you can never forget who you’re building it for. You can only have one customer. Choose wisely.*

**It's easier to bolt on B2B on a successful B2C company than vice versa.

*To withstand a complete lack of true work/life balance requires a clear organizational strategy. You need to prioritize. It’s important to have everything you need to think about written down and have a plan for when and how you’ll bring it up with your team. Otherwise it will swirl around in your brain endlessly, killing any meager chance you have of relaxing your shoulders for a minute.*

**Schedule your most important decisions and talks of the month. Put them out of your head until then.

*Every Sunday evening, I would go through my notes, reassess and reprioritize all my tasks, rifle through the good ideas, then update those papers on a computer and print out a new version for the week. Continually reprioritizing allowed me to zoom out and see what could be combined or eliminated. It let me spot moments when we were trying to do too much.
Those were the evenings when I’d realize why we were so overwhelmed—we had said “yes” to too many things and we needed to start saying “no.” And then came the hard work of figuring out what had to be delegated, what had to be delayed, and what had to be crossed off the list. I was forced to prioritize based on what really mattered, as opposed to what was just top of mind. That let me keep my eye on the bigger goals and milestones ahead of us, not just the fires at our feet or whatever feature we were most excited about that day.
Then Sunday night I’d email the whole list out to my management team.
Each item had a name attached to it. Everyone could look at the top of the list to see what I’d be focused on that week, what they were accountable for, and what the next major milestones were.
And every Monday, we’d have a meeting about it.
Everyone hated it. I literally watched people flinch when I’d bring out the papers, scanning them for the thing I’d been asking about for weeks.
That thing I’d refuse to forget about because it hadn’t gotten crossed off the list yet. On June 3 you said it would be ready by the end of the month. It’s now July—what’s the status of this project?
It wasn’t micromanagement. It was holding people accountable. It was holding everything in my head at the same time. It was holding on for dear life amid the flood of everything I needed to remember.*

**The prize you pay for accountability and getting things done is motivation. Is micromanaging really the best option for guaranteeing forward momentum? Couldn't this accountability check be decentralized? It'd not be as straightforward in that case which might make it less effective.

*Every time I left, I’d hand the reins over to a different person who reported to me. It’s your problem now, buddy! It was a time for the team to step up and learn to do what I did. Vacations are a great way to build a team’s future capabilities and see who might step into your shoes in the years to come. Everyone thinks they can do your job better—until they actually have to do it and deliver. So even if you’re in a high-stress job, you need to take vacations. They’re important for your team.*

**I've had this experience several times. The less essential you've made yourself the more autonomous your team will be, even in your absence.

*Sometimes when I just knew things were headed inexorably downhill, I left the office, rescheduled my meetings, and said, “Today is just one of those days—don’t make it worse than it already is.”
There are moments where you simply cannot function as a human, never mind a leader, and you need to recognize them and walk out the door.
Don’t make a bad decision because you’re frustrated and overworked—get your head on straight and come in fresh the next day.*

**I should be less afraid to break habits when it's necessary.

*This wasn’t a moment to stand back and let the team figure out what to do on their own. I needed to make sure people knew exactly what they were working on and had the tools to find solutions as fast as possible. I had to command and control.*

**In crisis mode you need extreme centralization, you need it to circumvent the latency added by self organization.

*There is always a temptation to obfuscate or couch everything in legalese—to say “mistakes were made” but never admit they were yours.
This will not work. People will figure it out. And they will be pissed.
If something is your fault, tell them what you did. Tell them what you’ve learned from it. And tell them how you’ll prevent it from ever happening again. No evading, blaming, or making excuses. Just accept responsibility and be a grown-up.
Every failure is a learning experience. A complete meltdown is a PhD program.*

It’s your responsibility as a leader not to try to deal with a disaster on your own. Don’t lock yourself in a room, alone, frantically trying to fix it.
Don’t hide. Don’t disappear. Don’t imagine that by working for a week straight and not sleeping you can solve the problem yourself and nobody ever has to know. Get advice. Take deep breaths. Make a plan.*

**Not only do you get advice, you're keeping them in the loop about what happened.

*The most valuable thing you’ll take out of any crisis is the tale of how you were almost swept away, but the team pulled together and saved the day. That story needs to enter into the DNA of your company so you can always return to it.
There will be more disasters in your future. There will be many moments when everything falls apart. But if you can keep telling that story, no crisis to come will ever feel quite as bleak as the very first one you conquered. Because you can always turn to your team and say, “Look. Look what we survived together. If we got through that, we can get through anything.”
It’s a useful corporate tool to remind people what can happen, what you’ve learned, and how to avoid similar disasters in the future. The story is handy managerially and as a cultural touchstone. But, most importantly, it’s true: your team got through this. Now they can get through anything.*

**I'd like to add the story part to our postmortems.

*We were going to show our investors that this was a world-class team who could perform miracles on a shoestring. With every squirrel invasion and ceiling leak our team was declaring that we were the opposite of every startup in the Valley that was lavishing money on their offices and launching nothing.
All of us were singularly committed to exactly one thing: our mission.
Those people in that garage and that urgent need to prove our vision formed the core of the hard-driving, mission-driven culture that defined Nest.*

**I believe a strong mission is absolutely necessary for getting the best people with a tight budget. Smart people do things for one of two reasons: purpose or money. Or both.  

---
Page: 216

*I also ask, “Why did you leave your last job?” Not the most original question, but the answer matters. I’m looking for a crisp, clear story. If they complain about a bad manager or being the victim of politics, I ask what they did about it. Why didn’t they fight harder? And did they leave a mess behind them? What did they do to make sure they left in the right way?*

**Attempting to fix the situation is the courageous thing to do.

*Every Monday morning at Nest, that’s how my management meetings started: Who are the great people we want to hire? Are we making our hiring goals or retention metrics? If not, what’s the problem? What are the roadblocks? And how is the team doing? What issues do people have? How are performance reviews going? Who needs a bonus? How are we going to celebrate these accomplishments so the team feels valued? And, most importantly, are people leaving? Why? How are we going to make this job more meaningful and fulfilling and exciting than anything else out there?
How are we going to help our people grow?*

**At kasta we don't care about the people at all. We don't seem to care about the mission either.

*What you’re building never matters as much as who you’re building it with.*

**Grow slowly and thoughtfully. Don't let growth water down the culture. Hire diversely, young people are important. Be very hands on the first few weeks, and then continuously create touchpoints where the culture is spread and maintained. Focus on developing your people. Fire when necessary but make sure they've had the chance to improve.

*I’ve had many conversations with entrepreneurs who told me they hate it when companies grow past 120 people, so they won’t let that happen in their own startup. But I’ve never seen it work—not for any successful business.
It’s either grow or die. Stasis is stagnation. Change is the only option.*

**This is not right. Depends on what you mean by successful. There are plenty of old small to midsized companies. Valve comes to mind.

*You’ll need to find ways to effectively communicate to the team, ensure that managers are communicating that same information to their teams, and make sure information from throughout the org funnels to the top. Lack of transparency from the bottom to the top and from the top to the bottom can breed distrust. Where there’s a lack of data, distrust fills that void.*

**Being able to keep transparent communication in a growing organization is tricky. 

---
Page: 227

*But you’ll also need to speak openly about how it’s scary for them and for you and for the company. Acknowledge that there are things that you’ll lose, and that those losses will not be easy. Involve managers and individuals in the process so it doesn’t just come out of left field, like something that was done to them that they have no control over. You need their help to get it right so they can define, own, and embrace the changes.*

**Change is easier to embrace if you're part of designing it.

Page: 228

*You’ll need to break your org into product specific groups so that each product gets the attention it deserves. This team works on the thermostat, this team works on the smoke alarm. And then you might have to subdivide again. At Nest we ended up creating a team for accessories; otherwise they’d have never gotten made. The mainline team would always say they’d get to it but the accessories projects were never their first priority, so they’d inevitably prioritize other things.*

**If a team focuses on multiple things, only one of those things will have the top priority. If you need something to get full attention all the time, create a specialized team for it.

Page: 231

*So these new directors shouldn’t just be dumped into the job with no support. They should be trained and assigned coaches from the outset.
Maybe that’s you, maybe it’s someone else, but formalize the relationship.
Help the new director realize that nobody expects them to know everything right away.*

**Throwing people into the deep end is setting them up for failure. It's in your best interest to maximize their chances of success. Their success is your success. 

---
Page: 236

*So when breakpoints come for you, remember how you’ve been reassuring the team and take your own advice: know they’re coming and get ready. Talk to your mentor. Understand what your job should look like well before every transition and plan for it. And always remember that change is growth and growth is opportunity. Your company is an organism;
its cells need to divide to multiply, they need to differentiate to become something new. Don’t worry about what you’re going to lose—think about what you’re going to become.*

**If you have a good metaview of your organization, you'll be able to guide its growth successfully. If you anticipate breakpoints and struggles, they will feel much less painful. 

---
Page: 237

*Avoid habituation: Everyone gets used to things. Life is full of tiny and enormous inconveniences that you no longer notice because your brain has simply accepted them as unchangeable reality and filtered them out.
For example, think about the little sticker that grocery stores put on produce. Instead of just eating an apple, you now have to find the sticker, peel it off, and scrape the gluey residue off with a fingernail. The first few times you encountered the sticker, you were probably annoyed.
By now you barely register it.
But when you think like a designer, you stay awake to the many things in your work and life that can be better. You find opportunities to improve experiences that people long ago assumed would just always be terrible.**

**What's the easiest way of keeping this going? One way that has worked for me is that I'm easier able to spot issues with products that are not my own. Netflix is an example, I don't have it and whenever I use it at someone else's place I can't see anything but how crappy it is. 

---
Page: 241

*To be a great designer you can’t lock yourself in a room—you have to connect with your team, with your customer and their environment, and other teams who may have innovative ideas to bring to the table. You have to understand your customer’s needs and all the different ways you can address them. You have to look at a problem from all angles. You have to get a little creative. And you have to notice the problem in the first place.
That last point doesn’t sound like a big deal. But it’s huge. It’s the difference between a startup employee and its founder.
Most people are so habituated to the problems in their home lives or work that they no longer realize they’re problems. They simply go about their day, get into bed, close their eyes, realize they left the lights on in the kitchen, groan and grump down the stairs, without ever thinking: Why is there no light switch in my bedroom that turns off all the lights in the house?
You can’t solve interesting problems if you don’t notice they’re there.*

**I've spoken to people that don't notice problems at all. It's like their minds are frozen when you try to open them up to the possibility that something could be changed.

*You’d get a new gadget, take it out of the box, then you’d have to plug it in for an hour before you could turn it on. It was annoying, but it was life.
Then Steve said, “We’re not going to let that happen to our product.”
It was typical for electronics to run for thirty minutes in the factory to make sure they worked. We ran the iPod for more than two hours. The factory slowed down. Way down. The manufacturing team complained;
costs added up. But that extra time not only let us test the iPod completely, it also gave the battery time to fully charge.
Now it’s de rigueur—all electronics come with a full battery. After Steve recognized the issue, so did everyone else.
It seems like a small thing, but it was meaningful. It mattered. You opened up the box and your iPod was there to meet you, ready to change your life.
Magic.
The kind of magic anyone can do.
You just have to notice the problem. And not wait around for someone to solve it for you.*

**Sometimes solving the problem is more valuable than efficiency. When everyone else sees that it is they'll also be forced to add that bit of inefficiency and suddenly it's not an inefficiency but a core part of the process.

*Rather than looking at how other companies do things—have always done things—and copying them, your team will begin to think like their customer: “Here’s how I would want to return this product.” Then they’ll design the process from scratch, the way it should be designed:
Ask why at every step—why is it like this now? How can it be better?
Think like a user who has never tried this product before; dig into their mindset, their pain and challenges, their hopes and desires.
Break it down into steps and set all the constraints up front. [See also:
Chapter 3.5: Heartbeats and Handcuffs.] Understand and tell the story of the product. [See also: Chapter 3.2:
Why Storytelling.] Create prototypes all along the way. [See also: Chapter 3.1: Make the Intangible Tangible.]*

**The constraints part here is really important, most companies are bleeding money and have a few months left to live. Endless prototyping needs to be cut short, you need to move ahead but you can't just move ahead with something that won't work. The less money you have the more precision you need with your constraints.

*“The best marketing is just telling the truth.”
If the messaging rings true, then the marketing is better. You don’t have to rely on bells and whistles, stunts, and dancing polar bears—you simply explain in the best way possible what you’re making and why you’re making it.
And you tell a story: you connect with people’s emotions so they’re drawn to your narrative, but you also appeal to their rational side so they can convince themselves it’s the smart move to buy what you’re selling.
You balance what they want to hear with what they need to know.*

**This requires that you actually have a product that delivers on what you promise.

---
Page: 254

*And when everyone can understand it, they can understand how important it is.*

**There's a risk of dismissing the value of things you don't understand, or actually overestimating the value of it.

*I approved everything we put out into the world. Especially in the beginning.
This wasn’t my area of expertise—I had watched Steve Jobs sell iPods and iPhones and work closely with marketing, but had never done it myself.
So the only way I could master marketing was to bury myself in it—to take the customer journey myself, to touch every touchpoint. So nothing was ever presented to me without context—I would always expect to see what came before, what came after. I’d need to know the story we were telling and to whom we were telling it and at what point of the journey they were.
An ad can’t be understood without knowing where it will appear and where it will lead to. A webpage can’t be approved until you know who will be routed to that page and what they’ll need to know and where the call to action will take them. Everything is connected to everything, so everything must be understood together.
It wasn’t micromanagement—it was care. I was putting the same amount of energy and time into the beginning of the customer journey as I put into the end. To those who aren’t used to it, that feels intense and unwarranted, but that was my job. [See also: Chapter 6.1: Becoming CEO:
So your job is to care.] I wanted the words and images that we used to describe our products to be as great as the products themselves. I wanted the entire experience to shine.*

**As precise as you can be with the architecture of your system,   you can be with every conceivable part of your company and your product. Maybe it requires a bit of handholding from the ceo in the beginning? 

---
Page: 251

*I wanted the marketing team to be as exacting as the engineering and manufacturing teams—to learn from this rigor so they would begin to push themselves just as hard, or harder, than I pushed them.*

**There's no reason for marketing to be every bit as rigorous as engineering. A bad impression should be treated just as seriously as a critical bug. For the customer in that part of the journey it will have the same bad effect or even worse. 

---
Page: 258

*Most tech companies break out product management and product marketing into two separate roles: Product management defines the product and gets it built. Product marketing writes the messaging—the facts you want to communicate to customers—and gets the product sold.
But from my experience that’s a grievous mistake. Those are, and should always be, one job. There should be no separation between what the product will be and how it will be explained—the story has to be utterly cohesive from the beginning.
Your messaging is your product. The story you’re telling shapes the thing you’re making.*

**I've felt the pains of this at Kasta. It's quite clear that there's a disconnect between the tech and the messaging and the what and why. There's nothing that holds it all together.

*Battery life mattered to customers. And it mattered to Steve Jobs. You couldn’t just come to Steve and say, “The next version of the iPod is going to have a twelve-hour battery instead of fifteen like the last version.” You’d get thrown out of the meeting.*

**It's kind of charming, the level of quality and expertise that's unwaveringly expected. 

---
Page: 262

*The customer story helped engineering understand the pain point. They built a product to address that pain. Then marketing crafted a narrative that gave every person who had experienced the pain a reason to buy the product.
The thread that tied all these people and teams and pains and desires together was product management. For every successful product and company, all parts of your business end up leading back to them—it’s all hinged together in one central point.
This is why product managers are the hardest people to hire and train.
It’s why the great ones are so valuable and so beloved. Because they have to understand it all, make sense of it. And they do it alone. They’re one of the most important teams at a company and one of the smallest.*

**It's what keeps the conceptual integrity of the whole product intact. It's what resolves all competing tensions and constraints into something that's harmonious. 

---
Page: 265

*The best salespeople are the ones who maintain relationships even if it means not making money that day.
Those are the salespeople you want on your team. Because if you do it right, they truly will become part of the team, rather than mercenaries who swoop in, make their money, then jump ship to the next hot company, leaving a trail of problems behind them.
The danger with traditional commission-based sales models is that they create two different cultures: a company culture and a sales culture. The employees in these two cultures are compensated differently, think differently, care about different things. Hopefully most people in your company will be focused on the mission—on achieving something great together, grinding away at a big, shared goal. Many salespeople won’t give two shits about your mission. They’ll be focused on how much they’re making month to month.*

**You want harmony across all parts of the organization. Having a silo that only cares for itself is akin to cancer. 

---
Page: 268

*Ideally you set up your business this way from the start. Everyone gets paid in salary, stock, and performance bonuses—sales, customer success, support, marketing, engineering, everyone. That’s not to say they get paid the same amount, but the compensation model is the same—everyone is aligned.
And nobody ever works a sale alone. During the sales process, the salesperson has backup from customer success or support or whoever will be working closely with the customer post-sale. And then those teams sign off on the deal. There are never any surprises—everyone knows exactly what’s expected of them to make this new customer successful. And once the deal is closed, the salesperson doesn’t disappear. They stay on as a point of contact for that customer, and if there’s any kind of issue, they step in to resell them.*

**I like the completeness of the author's thinking, he always cover all aspects of the company.

*These people exist. They’re tired of transactional cultures, too. They want to do right by their customers. They want to feel like part of a real team. Hire them.*

**The world is vast, there are compatible people out there for everyone. If you think the world is wrong in some ways, chances are there are people who'd agree with you. 

---
Page: 269

*It might not be easy. Especially if there’s a ton of competition for talent.
There are situations and industries where building a whole new sales culture and organization just isn’t feasible. In that case, you just need one. Find a sales leader who understands and values customer relationships—someone who won’t stand for egoism or cutthroat competition and who won’t hire assholes or mercenaries. That leader will shape the culture of their organization to be more relationship-oriented, until the world catches up to what you’re doing and you can implement vested commissions.*

**You could look for someone with potential and help them grow into the role. That way you get someone who's values were right from the start and whose skills are customized to your company.

Page: 274

*We needed a leader who already had a deep understanding of the issues that would be at the heart of our business, who could think that way from day one and build his team with that perspective in mind. And we needed someone who could act as a moral compass, who could go toe-to-toe with execs and engineers and marketers.
We needed a leader who could lead.
Who would be respected and thoughtful enough to be an active part of product development.
Chip and his team were never back-office. They were always in the thick of it with us, thinking through product features, making sure we could defend our patents, looking over our marketing copy, beating back lawsuits.
And getting into fights with me.*

**You don't need to have any department in your company that feels like a necessary evil. Everyone can contribute creatively from their perspective with whatever they're responsible for. A powerful legal department can be a competitive edge.

*The CEO sets the tone for the company—every team looks to the CEO and the exec team to see what’s most critical, what they need to pay attention to. So Andy showed them. He stepped into the rain and looked at the engines, the upholstery, the dashboards, the exhaust pipes, everything.
He rejected any car that wasn’t perfect.
If a leader gets distracted from the customer—if business goals and spreadsheets full of numbers for shareholders become a higher priority than customer goals—the whole organization can easily forget what’s most important.*

**We've fallen into the spreadsheet trap. Everything about the business is just arbitrary movements in spreadsheets. Nothing about purpose, impact or the customer.

*When you truly give a shit, you care, you don’t let up until you’re satisfied, you pick things apart until they’re great.
People will hand you something that they worked on tirelessly for weeks, that they’ve thought through and are proud of, that’s 90 percent amazing. And you will tell them to go back and make it better. Your team will be shocked, stunned, possibly even dejected. They’ll say it’s already so good, we’ve worked so hard.
You’ll say good enough is not good enough. So they’ll march out the door and do it again. And, if necessary, again. They might get so tangled up that it’ll be simpler to just start from scratch. But with each iteration, each new version, each regroup and reimagining, they’ll discover something new. Something great. Something better.
Most people are happy with 90 percent good. Most leaders will take pity on their teams and just let it slide. But going from 90 to 95 percent is halfway to perfect. Getting the last part of the journey right is the only way to reach your destination.
So you push. Yourself. The team. You push people to discover how great they can be. You push until they start pushing back. In these moments, always err on the side of almost-too-much. Keep pushing until you find out if what you’re asking for is actually impossible or just a whole lot of work.
Get to the point of pain so you start to see when the pain is becoming real.
That’s when you back down and find a new middle ground.
It’s not easy. But all that attention, that care, the quest for perfection— they’ll raise the team’s own standards. What they expect of themselves.
After a while, they’ll work incredibly hard not just to make you happy, but because they know how much pride they feel when they do world-class work. The entire culture will evolve to expect excellence from each other.*

**I think he knows this but it's important not to forget all the groundwork necessary to be able to push a team to its limits. You can't just micromanage all output, you need to fertilize the ground with psychological safety, with the necessary conditions for learning and getting better, with bright people, with very clear values, a very clear vision and more.

*As talks moved forward, I stuck to my word. I left Nest. Walked away from our marriage. They said they wanted a divorce so I gave them a divorce.
And then, months after I left, Google changed their mind. Again.
They decided not to sell Nest after all.
In fact, they decided that Nest was better as part of Google rather than being lumped in with the “other bets” of Alphabet. And Nest was reabsorbed.
It was the strategy du jour—join Google, leave Google, join Google. All the while, Nest’s management team had to stand in front of employees and promise that everything was going to be great! But there was no denying that the flip-flopping was painful—for our customers, for the team, for their families. Executive management seemed to have an utter disregard for our employees and the work they were trying to achieve.*

**It sounds like a nightmare, I'm impressed he stayed for so long but I'm a bit disappointed in the people staying when it's obvious they were treated like dirt.

*It’s a cliché to say “It’s lonely at the top.” But it’s also true.
Most people assume being CEO is a hard job—stressful, busy, high-pressure. But the stress is one thing; the isolation is another. You might have a cofounder, but you shouldn’t have a co-CEO. It’s a one-person job and you’re all alone up there.
And just because you’re in charge does not mean you’re in control. You plan out your day, think you’re finally going to have some time to talk to people, look at the product, meet with engineering. Then your day disappears. There’s always some new crisis, some new people problem, someone quitting, someone complaining, someone falling apart.
And you can never tell if you’re getting it right. When you’re an independent contributor, you can typically look at something you’ve made that week and be proud of it. When you’re a manager, you can look at the collective achievement of your team and feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. When you’re a CEO, you dream that maybe, ten years down the road, some people will think you did a good job. But you can never tell how you’re doing in the moment. You can never sit back and look at a job well done.
This job can suck you dry if you let it.
It can also be one of the most liberating experiences of your life.
Since I was a kid, I tried to convince people to follow my crazy ideas. I spent so much time and energy and emotion desperately trying to get them to do things differently. The crazier the idea, the more it cut against the grain, the longer and harder I had to fight for it.
And so often the answer I got was no. No. Not right now. Long before Apple got into the game, I pitched the concept for an early iPod-like MP3 player to RealNetworks, Swatch, Palm. Everyone turned it down. No. No.
Maybe we’ll consider it next quarter. Maybe next year.
But when you’re CEO, you’re in charge. Sure, you’re constrained by money or resources or your board, but for the first time there are no constraints on your ideas. You get to finally test out the things that other people told you couldn’t be done. It’s your opportunity to put your money where your mouth is.
That freedom is thrilling and empowering and utterly terrifying. There is nothing scarier than finally getting what you want and having to take responsibility for it, good or bad. And the tables begin to turn—as CEO you can’t say “yes” to everything. You have to become the one who says “no.”
Freedom is a double-edged sword.
But it’s still a sword. You can use it to cut through the bullshit, the hesitation, the red tape, the habituation. You can use it to create whatever you want. The right way. Your way.
You can change things.
That’s why you start a company. That’s why you become CEO.*

**I can deal with loneliness and I love freedom. I can't be anything but CEO.

*In this job, respect is always more important than being liked.
You can’t please everyone. Trying can be ruinous.
CEOs have to make incredibly unpopular decisions—lay people off, kill projects, rearrange teams. Often you’ll have to take decisive action, hurt people to save the company, to cut out a cancer. You can’t skip surgery because you don’t want to upset Team Tumor.
Delaying hard decisions, hoping problems will resolve themselves, or keeping pleasant but incompetent people on the team might make you feel better. It may give you the illusion of niceness. But it chips away at the company, bit by bit, and erodes the team’s respect for you.*

**A good parent will sacrifice their own happiness for the longterm wellbeing of their child.

*After your product launch, and hopefully with revenue coming in, your board meetings will focus more on data and what’s happening externally— what’s the competition doing, what are customers asking for, how well are we attracting and retaining customers, what kinds of partnerships have you set up. And as always when you’re presenting numbers, it becomes much more important to craft a narrative. You have to tell a story. [See also:
Chapter 3.2: Why Storytelling.] Your board isn’t in the business every day like you are—they can’t immediately understand the nuances or what the numbers actually mean unless you give them context.*

**Telling a story is absolutely crucial when it comes to getting people with very limited inside knowledge to more deeply understand what you're trying to do.

Page: 303

*Even the best CEO cannot stand alone, untouchable, unchallengeable, accountable to no one. Everyone needs to report to someone, even if it’s a two-person board that you meet with for an hour every few months.
There always needs to be some kind of pressure-release valve. There always needs to be someone who can shake their head and give it to you straight.*

**I disagree with this. Go to your team for fuck sake. Advice from extremely experienced people is always great but sometimes you just need to make your own mistakes. 

---
Page: 305

*So don’t make everyone wait and gossip and squirm. At Nest, most of the exec team knew exactly what was going on because they were in the boardroom with me, and we always showed a redacted version of the board presentation to the whole company as soon as possible after the meeting.
Here’s what we talked about, here’s what I’m concerned about, this is what the board had questions about, here are actions we’ll take.
It kept everyone in lockstep and quashed rumors. And if something changed, people were able to start working on those changes right away.*

**Maximum possible transparency is usually the simplest and most efficient mode of operation.

*Sundar Pichai told me that all the teams we were trying to work with were very busy. They didn’t have extra cycles to dedicate to Nest. And no one at Google could simply dictate to them how to get things done—it was up to the teams to decide how to use their time.*

**Being organic and decentralized has the downside of not being as predictable and controllable.

Page: 314

*Culture is incredibly sticky. I should have remembered that. Larry, with Bill Campbell’s prodding, wanted Nest to come in and shift Google’s entire way of thinking, to give it a burst of startup mojo. But culture doesn’t work that way—you can’t repaint an old factory and show the workers a training video and think you’ve made any kind of difference. You have to tear the whole thing down and rebuild it again.
Most people and companies need a near-death experience before they can really change.
You can’t assume acquisition will mean acculturation. That’s why Apple doesn’t really buy companies with large teams. They only acquire specific teams or technologies, usually very early in their life cycle when they’re pre-revenue. That way they can easily be absorbed and Apple never has to worry about culture. They can also skip the inevitable duplication of functions between existing teams like finance, legal, and sales, or the painful process of integrating one large team into another. With the notable exception of the Beats acquisition, Apple has been laser focused on filling small, specialized technology gaps in their evolving products rather than acquiring whole new lines of business.
All acquisitions come down to what you’re trying to do when you’re buying a company—do you want to buy a team? Technology? Patents?
Product? Customer base? Business (that is, revenue)? A brand? Some other strategic assets?
When you’re selling, the same questions apply. What are you looking for? Some hope to use a larger company’s resources to accelerate their vision. Others are looking for financial gain. Then there are the companies who are having problems and are trying to sell off the business to someone who believes in it.*

**Culture is what the company does. It could theoretically change over night. In reality you need to get people on board, then you need to massively shift what you're doing and how you're doing it. Although I could see how you can make culture shifts slowly and smoothly. Apple are actually quite thoughtful in removing the culture question from the equation.

*You should absolutely do nice things for your employees. You should surely reward them for their hard work. But you have to remember how the human brain works. There’s a psychology to entitlement.
If you want to give employees a perk, keep in mind two things:
1. When people pay for something, they value it. If something is free, it is literally worthless. So if employees get a perk all the time, then it should be subsidized, not free.
2. If something happens only rarely, it’s special. If it happens all the time, the specialness evaporates. So if a perk is only received occasionally, it can be free. But you should make it very clear that this is not going to be a regular occurrence and change up the perk so it’s always a surprise.*

**I wonder if this applies to customers as well. If they pay for something they'll value it rather than feel entitled to it.

*It’s your job as a CEO to constantly push your company forward—to come up with new ideas and projects to keep it fresh and alive. Then it’s your job to work hard on those new projects, to be as passionate about them as you were about the original problem you came there to solve. In the meantime, other people on your team focus on your core business, optimizing the pieces that are already set up.
If you can’t get excited about that, if you can’t come up with new ideas or embrace the daring ones that your team dreams up, then that’s a pretty good sign: you’ve become a babysitter. It’s time to go.*

**I think this is true for any job. If you're not passionately digging deeper, you're not interested anymore.

*There’s a half-life to everything.
In my experience it takes most people about a year and a half before they can start thinking about something new. There’s a reason people in some cultures wear black for twelve months after a death. That’s how long it takes to come to terms with this kind of loss.
The first three to six months will creep by as you get over the initial shock, the denial and possibly anger, the gnashing of teeth and tearing of hair when you see what they’re doing to your baby. It will also take you that long to get through the list of crap you’ve been meaning to do but had been ignoring because of work. Only after you exhaust that list can you stop getting distracted by the past and start getting bored. This is a necessary step. You absolutely need to get bored before you can find new things to be inspired by.
It will take another six months to start reengaging with the world. To stop caring quite as much about what went wrong. To start learning new things, finding your curiosity again.
Then for the next six months you can begin to look at your life with fresh eyes. Get distracted. Get excited. Start thinking about what’s next.*

**Don't suppress your emotions, process them and integrate them. Make the most of what you had.

*The thing holding most people back is themselves. They think they know what they can do and who they’re supposed to be, and they don’t explore beyond those boundaries.
That is, until someone comes along and pushes them—willingly or unwillingly, happily or unhappily—into doing something more. Into discovering a well of creativity or willpower or brilliance that they never realized they had.*

**I need an internal power to push myself beyond my limits. I want the day to have felt exhausting and meaningful, and be excited to be able to go at it the next day.
