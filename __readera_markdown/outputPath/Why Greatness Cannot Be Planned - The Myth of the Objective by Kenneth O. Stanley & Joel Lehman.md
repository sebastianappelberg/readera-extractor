*The idea that all our pursuits can be distilled into neatly-def i ned objectives and then almost mechanically pursued offers a kind of comfort against the harsh unpredictability of life.*

**There are so many situations, thoughts and feelings that cannot be accurately described by language. Those are sometimes the deepest and most precious parts of life. Without being able to express something, we cannot properly formulate an objective for it. The shades of grey are infinite.

*The structure of the search space—the great room of all possible things—is just plain weird. It’s so bad that the objective can actually distract you from its own stepping stones! If you think too much about computers you’ll never think of vacuum tubes. The problem is that ambitious objectives are often deceptive.
They dangle a false promise of achievement if we pursue them purposefully. But strangely in the end we often must give them up ever to have the chance of reaching them.*

**This is why I'm hesitant at times to allow myself to see what others have already discovered. It puts me on the wrong track. It narrows my thinking. 

---
Page: 16

*The moral of course is that objectives have to be realistic for us to have the hope of reaching them. The idea of a large imaginary “room” whose space is being searched is a metaphor that helps to see why this principle holds.*

**This feels like a key part of the innovator's dilemma. You're so risk-averse and efficient that there's no room for wandering around.

Page: 24

*Who would have thought that so many disparate scenarios would follow this strange yet fundamental principle? The key is to be open to change, to a shifting landscape where appearances can be deceiving yet liberating at the same time.
The great achievers are willing to abandon their original objectives and spring for opportunity when it arises. What is important in these scenarios is to avoid locking into rigid commitment to the original ambitious objective, and instead remaining mindful and open to where the present stepping stone might lead. Sometimes all it takes is sensing potential—whether it be in becoming a musician or f i nding a new way to cook—even if the true nature of that potential is still unknown.*

**How does one set themselves up for wandering this way?

*“Those that go searching for love, only manifest their own lovelessness. And the loveless never f i nd love, only the loving f i nd love. And they never have to seek for it [24].”*

**It's not exactly the same thing but I have realized that loving someone doesn't involve making them behave the way you expect them to. It's more about jamming with who an what they want to. It's about letting go of them and support them.

---
Page: 25

*Because no one knows the stepping stones that lead to the greatest discoveries, the last thing we want to do is stop people from exploring stepping stones that we ourselves choose to ignore—who knows what they will f i nd?*

**This is the danger of basins of attraction and dogma in science, they force people into one way of doing things. They close the door to serendipity.

*I will not follow where the path may lead, but I will go where there is no path, and I will leave a trail.*

**The mindset of a pioneer. It's no fun to explore what has already been explored.

*Yes, abandoning objectives is often the best decision, but there’s a reason for this pattern, which is that the stepping stones almost never resemble the f i nal destination, whether planned or not. In other words, no matter how tempting it is to believe in it, the distant objective cannot guide you to itself—it is the ultimate false compass.*

**So what are people looking at if not the final goal? How do they make decisions about the next step? Randomness? Gut feeling? Can you have a gut feeling for everything?

Page: 41

*It created them because nature is a stepping-stone collector, accumulating steps towards ever-more complicated novelties, marching onward onto the mist-cloaked lake of possible life-forms, heading eternally both everywhere and nowhere in particular. That’s the signature, now increasingly familiar, of processes that produce amazing innovations.*

**What about bandwidth? How can we afford to explore everything all the time? How does one sustain a stepping stone collector?

---
Page: 44

*The genius of the Wright brothers wasn’t to invent every necessary component for f l ight from scratch, but to recognize that we were only a stepping stone away from f l ight given past innovations. Great invention is def i ned by the realization that the prerequisites are in place, laid before us by predecessors with entirely unrelated ambitions, just waiting to be combined and enhanced. The f l ash of insight is seeing the bridge to the next stepping stone by building from the old ones. And the story of those stepping stones is not a story of intentional objective-driven building, one piece at a time towards some distant über-invention as conceived by an overarching plan.*

**How does one know when all the stepping stones are there?

**Isn't each stepping stone connected to an immediate goal? Just because what they enabled wasn't part of an objective, doesn't mean that they were created without an objective in mind. The Wright brother's objective was in fact to build an airplane.

---
Page: 46

*Perhaps the effort invested in specifying clear objectives would be sometimes better spent in identifying promising stepping stones, but not specif i cally those leading to the objective. After all, the objective offers few clues to what its stepping stones should be. So maybe there’s a different way to think about search. Instead of worrying about where we want to be, we could compare where we are now to where we have been. If we f i nd ourselves somewhere genuinely novel, then this novel discovery may later prove a stepping stone to new frontiers. While we may not know what those frontiers are, the present stepping stone becomes the gateway to f i nding out.*

**I like this way of thinking. Pick up something from where you're currently at and ask yourself, has this thing been done already? If not then it's worth exploring. The tricky part is to actually find out if it has been done already.

*The beacon of air travel says nothing of induction coils and the beacon of computation says nothing of vacuum tubes. Even so, long ago we visited those very stepping stones entirely unaware that they might lead to such distant horizons.*

**But wasn't that because they were associated with an objective that was more obviously related to what they are? 

---
Page: 47

*The past doesn’t tell us about the objective but it does offer a clue to something equally if not more important—the past is a guide to novelty. But unlike the future, there’s no ambiguity and no deception because we actually know where we were in the past, so we know how it compares to where we are today. Instead of judging our progress towards a goal, the past allows us to judge our liberation from the outdated. Interestingly, the question then changes from what we’re approaching to what we’re escaping. And the exciting thing about escaping the past is that it opens new possibilities.
The point is that novelty can often act as a stepping stone detector because anything novel is a potential stepping stone to something even more novel. In other words, novelty is a rough shortcut for identifying interestingness: Interesting ideas are those that open up new possibilities. And while it might sound wishy-washy to go looking for “interesting” things, interestingness is a surprisingly deep and important concept. In the words of the famous philosopher Alfred Whitehead [42]:
“It is more important that a proposition be interesting than it be true.” W.T. Stace [43], another philosopher, adds that “the criticism that interestingness is a trivial end proceeds from a scale of values thus perverted and turned upside down.” Far from trivial, novel and interesting ideas tend to suggest new ways of thinking that lead to further novelties.
The important point is that novelty (and interestingness) can compound over time by continually making new things possible. So instead of seeking a f i nal objective, by looking for novelty the reward is an endless chain of stepping stones branching out into the future as novelty leads to further novelty. Rather than thinking of the future as a destination, it becomes a road, a path of undef i ned potential. This non-objective perspective captures better the spirit of processes like Picbreeder, evolution in nature, and human innovation—ratcheting processes that build stepping stone upon stepping stone, branching and diverging ever outward to everywhere and nowhere in particular.*

Page: 48

*In short, objectives mean sailing to a distant destination with an unknown path while novelty requires only steering away from where we’ve been already. Deviating from the past is simpler and richer with information because we can look at the whole history of past discoveries to inform our judgment of current novelty. So it’s not unreasonable to believe that novelty is a meaningful engine for progress.
Another clue to the importance of novelty in innovation is that humans tend to be very sensitive to it. Often we feel the urge to explore a particular path or idea despite being unsure where it might lead. Our intuitions and hunches often prod us in directions that might not be justif i ed objectively but still lead to something different or interesting. So it’s no coincidence that the concept of interestingness comes up naturally when discussing novelty. When an idea feels genuinely novel, that’s often enough to make us curious. The idea interests us even if its ultimate purpose is unclear.*

**Chasing novelty is not a random procedure. Going towards novelty is directed but not towards a goal, rather it's a property of how the search should be done. A little bit like the constraints that evolution puts on what paths are explored fully.

*Crashing into various walls may not sound that exciting, but what happens next is magical and highlights the power of novelty search. At some point, after crashing into enough walls, there are no more new walls to crash into. At that moment, novelty search has exhausted all the options for crashing and a remarkable fact comes into play: The only way for the robot to do something novel is now by not crashing. This advance is interesting because learning to avoid walls was never expressed as an objective. But even though it wasn’t the objective, the robot seeking only novelty eventually must learn to avoid walls anyway to have the hope of continuing to produce novel behaviors.*

**What happens if the search space is too large? Sometimes there's an infinite amount of ways to fail.

---
Page: 53

*The point is that what is considered novel depends completely upon time and context. In fact, before the search begins we can’t even say which behaviors are more or less novel because novelty is a relative measure. That’s why considering novelty in isolation makes no sense—how new something is depends on what’s been seen before.
Objective-driven search is much different: A car with a more eff i cient engine is always more eff i cient than a car with a less eff i cient engine, no matter when either of them was invented. The point is that what’s better and what’s worse doesn’t change when searching for an objective. Because novelty search can’t provide such a consistent notion of bad and good, it also can’t provide an ordering from bad to good. But it does in fact provide a more interesting ordering: from simple to complex.*

**The sort order is the solution to infinite search spaces. By objective measures, novelty search may take paths that leads to worse results, but from a novelty point of view it still makes sense.

---
Page: 54

*Interestingly, novelty search is not the only kind of search that accumulates information. Information accumulation and increasing complexity are the tell-tale signs of any kind of search without an explicit objective. Novelty search is a special kind of non-objective search, but others, such as natural evolution, clearly exhibit this signature dynamic as well. While natural evolution is different from novelty search (their relation will be explored in greater depth in the f i rst case study), it shares with novelty search the key property that what it ultimately produces is not its objective. For that reason again, natural evolution also becomes a simple-to-complex information accumulator.*

**This is it, this is the explanation for why it feels like the universe moves towards greater and greater complexity. Some of our technologies accelerates our novelty search, in fact we're building exponential tech that will accelerate the acceleration. 

---
Page: 54

*That’s why the creatures of Earth have become a kind of mirror held up to the world that ref l ects back in tremendous diversity the physical possibilities enabled by our universe.*

**Profound and beautiful. Information accumulating behaviors seems to be rewarded because the more information you have about your context the better you can navigate it. And in a sense the world around us is defined by survivorship bias. 

**AI lives in a different context from us, in fact we decide it, how can we design the context in a way that let's AI go from simple to complex?

*It just looks at what the robot is doing and tries new versions of behaviors that were novel when they were discovered. So if the robot falls on its face, that’s good as long as the robot never fell down before in the same way. What do you think a biped robot looking for novelty would eventually end up doing?
It turns out that the answer is that the robot learned to walk (Fig. 5.3). In fact, it learned to walk better than when it tried to learn with the objective of walking. In other words, a robot that tried to walk farther and farther actually ended up walking less far than one that simply tried to do something novel again and again. As usual the reason is because of deception: The stepping stones to walking aren’t necessarily good walking, or even balancing. Falling down and kicking your legs may be a better stepping stone than trying to take a step*

**It's quite clear that this is how babies learn. They are in constant search for novelty, and their capabilities increase further and further the more things they try out. They accumulate because they're driven to further explore what they perceive to hold even more opportunities for exploration. 

---
Page: 58

*The question of what behavior is good or not good is important because the good ideas are the ones that the program will explore further. In other words, the hope for novelty search is that good ideas could be stepping stones to something interesting.
So after trying a bunch of behaviors, the program then decides to concentrate on the ones that seemed interesting. To do that, it takes those novel ideas and slightly alters them to see if something even more interesting and novel comes out. For example, if the robot goes around a wall it’s never gone around before, then chances are that a slight modif i cation of that behavior might go even further. On the other hand, if the robot does something it’s done many times before, like crash into a wall, then that behavior is ignored and not explored further.*

**How does the robot get the feedback? What sensors you have must be almost as important as the environment, since the perceived environment is in the interaction between the sensor and the environment. 

---
Page: 64

*So the idea that we simply need more diversity—but still should focus on objectives overall—is a false promise. The problem is that it denies an unavoidable inconvenience: A false compass remains false no matter how far you meander from its path.
That’s why there’s no easy way to interpret novelty search without letting go of some faith in objectives. While simply searching for novelty is def i nitely not a solution to every problem (even if it works some of the time), combining a drive for novelty with a drive towards the objective won’t cure deception either. And of course objectives on their own are even worse. So we’re going to have to accept something slightly humbling: Maybe the whole idea that there is some kind of “best practice” for f i nding your objective is misguided. There may simply be futility at the heart of search—no approach to searching can guarantee that you reach your 58 6 Long Live the Treasure Hunter objectives. It’s not enough to give up the idea that objectives are the best way to direct a search. We’ve seen that they’re not. But we’ll also have to abandon the idea that anything can always reveal the path to an ambitious objective.*

**What does slimemolds have to say about this? Is there a part of biology that can perform quantum novelty search? 

**Non-objective search needs a completely different mindset. You need to tune your interest and novelty sensors and kind of let the wind take you where it may.

---
Page: 67

*Human feedback can even play a role, as it does in Picbreeder, capitalizing on our diverse tastes and insights. And once humans begin to contribute, a lot of practical possibilities open up.*

**How can this be systematized and scaled up?

Page: 66

*But here’s where novelty search takes the plot on a surprising twist. The situation may sound hopeless, but the conclusion is both more subtle and more profound than it seems: We can reliably f i nd something amazing. We just can’t say what that something is!
The insight is that great discoveries are possible if they’re left undef i ned. This statement draws on the results from Picbreeder and from the processes of natural evolution and human innovation. It’s true that the outcome for novelty search versus objective-driven search in the previous chapter casts a shadow over objectives.
Those results showed that objectives can be outperformed by a more clever kind of objective ignorance. But the more important lesson of non-objective search is that it’s a powerful treasure hunter. However, instead of f i nding a particular treasure that you might have in mind, as it diverges through the search space it f i nds many treasures, all of which may be surprises. The novelty search experiments conf i rm that some treasures that are diff i cult to reach through objectives can be more easily reached without them. But there’s just no way to say exactly which treasures can be reached. All we know is that some places are within reach that otherwise would not be, whether they are places we want to visit or not.*

**What's an optimal amount of novelty in life? How does one listen for and expose themselves to opportunities?

*And we know which chairs are the treasures because we know which chairs the customers ultimately buy. So when a new customer arrives, the initial presentation of available models can be a collection of discoveries bred and then purchased by previous customers. In this way, even if they don’t realize it, the customers end up exploring the space of chairs together, jumping off from the favored discoveries of their predecessors. The old-fashioned online furniture catalog just became fresh and renewed: It’s now a collaborative search with no unif i ed objective—a treasure hunter.*

**This might be the answer to the question of scale. The thing is that we start over so many times, it's rare for accumulation of stepping stones to happen. We instead rediscover the same stepping stone over and over. Another issue is that it can require quite a lot of resources to test if a stepping stone is actually useful. 

**This whole idea of applying the picbreeder concept to everything we consume feels like the forefather of generative art.

---
Page: 69

*The irony is that inexperienced amateurs coming into the catalog with no unif i ed objective whatsoever are for these reasons sometimes more likely to f i nd the hidden treasures.*

**The more beginners we have exploring the higher the likelihood of a lucky punch. Though I would assume that there would be some diminishing returns to this.

*You show me anything that depicts institutional progress in America: school test scores, crime stats, arrest reports, anything that a politician can run on, anything that someone can get a promotion on. And as soon as you invent that statistical category, f i fty people in that institution will be at work trying to f i gure out a way to make it look as if progress is occurring when actually none is.*

**Are incentives and objectives always doomed to fail? I know only of bad examples, I have never heard about when a measurement has been successful without externalities.

---
Page: 72

*When the quest for progress is packaged into a measure, the result is an objective-driven approach. If the objective is ambitious, then a drive to increase objective performance is likely to produce deception, preventing the best possible result from being discovered. For example, GDP (gross domestic product) is a measure of national productivity. Of course, as a nation, the hope is to maximize GDP, which makes maximal GDP a kind of national objective. But once again, an increase in GDP does not mean that economic policies, if continued, will lead to even higher GDP. The economy could be stuck in a Chinese f i nger trap—a decrease might be needed to produce a much larger increase.*

**A major driver of Chinese finger trap dynamics is fear of being punished by people who have power over you. It may be your boss, your voters, a regulator,  etc. Anything but numbers going up gets people scapegoating. There are counterexamples, for example it's not uncommon for good CEOs to convince their shareholders to take a short-term hit to increase profits long-term.

*The only effect is that students everywhere will come to be graded by exactly the same misleading measurements (that do not lead to the ultimate objective even when accurate), and education everywhere will aim towards achieving the same deceptive objectives. So unless we’re sure we have uncovered an ultimate solution to the overwhelmingly complex problem of education, the yardsticks and objectives we converge to will be yet another broken compass, only this time it will be rebranded with the shiny off i cial stamp of “gold standard.” It’s just another version of the same f l awed reasoning that would seek more accurate broken compasses. The lesson is that a misleading measurement tool doesn’t improve when it’s made more accurate or adopted universally.
However, imposing uniformity also inf l icts more subtle wounds, because beyond having no inherent benef i ts, it also undermines making future discoveries. Enforcing uniform standards means converging to a single standard. It means extinguishing the diversity of alternative standards that individual schools or states might currently be exploring. As a result, it becomes more likely that future standards and tests will be limited to tweaks of the imposed status quo—because it is the only one applied and explored by teachers in their classrooms.*

**What makes education even more complex is that it constantly needs to change as the world around it changes. With the introduction of tools like the calculator or chatGPT, the way that humans wield their intellect changed which requires education to adapt. Same thing goes for any social or cultural shifts, we might live in a world one day where people have a very different role.

*The problem is that when individuals with opposing preferences are forced to vote, the winner often represents no one’s ideals (which perhaps explains the nearly-universal frustration people have with politics). Seeking consensus prevents traveling down interesting stepping stones because people don’t agree on what the most interesting stepping stones are. And resolving this kind of disagreement often leads to a compromise between opposing stepping stones. Like a faded gray that results from mixing the sharp contrasts of black and white together, the product of such compromise often dilutes the two original ideals. For the scientist writing a proposal, the result is that the best way to win a grant is to propose the perfect compromise, the best faded gray—good enough to satisfy everyone, but unlikely to lead anywhere highly novel or interesting. So when consensus is sought in exploration, the result is a generic washout effect. Instead of allowing each person to discover their own chains of stepping stones, the system squashes a diversity of opinions into a generic average.*

**Like all Marvel movies ever created. When is compromise good if ever?

Page: 87

*Note that we’re not suggesting that all-around poor proposals should be funded.
If experts all agree that an idea is terrible, as in poor, poor, poor, poor, then there’s no evidence that it’s worth pursuing. But when experts radically disagree with each other, something interesting is happening. Darwin’s theory of evolution was dismissed by many experts when it was f i rst introduced [83]—a good sign! Thomas Kuhn spoke of paradigm shifts in which the present framework of science begins to crack. At those moments discord is the mark of revolution [84]. For all these reasons, some of our resources should go towards rewarding disagreement rather than consensus.*

**This is the creative abrasion necessary for innovation. Couple this together with integrative decision making and you almost have a complete innovation machine.

---
Page: 92

*As usual, you might ask how we can so smugly idolize stepping stones without knowing where they lead. But that’s just the fading whisper of objective thinking.
As we’ve seen, there’s good reason to believe that not knowing where we’re going is perfectly f i ne—and can actually lead to a brighter future of discovery. Not knowing where we’re going is the way of the information accumulator, it’s the treasure hunter, it’s the stepping-stone collector, it’s the path to everywhere and nowhere, it’s the tunnel to the future. We don’t know where we’re going and that’s why we produce great things. Consensus, perceived importance, alignment with national interests— these are “objective” parachutes for escaping the great unknown when we should be rocketing further into it.*

**At the early stages of our lives we are encouraged to explore, but as we grow older it is expected of us to have figured it out and to start specializing. I personally don't like to be narrow and reductionist. I want to be systematic and holistic.

*Of course, when art and design collide, such as in architecture, objectives do sometimes play a role. The roof has to keep the rain out. The foundation must be stable. It turns out there’s an interesting parallel here between these kinds of “objectives” and the constraints on organisms in natural evolution. Every organism in nature must live long enough to survive and reproduce. But there are a multitude of divergent ways to meet this “objective,” ref l ected in the vast diversity of life on Earth. From tulips to trees to tarantulas, life is creative within its constraints. So in a similar way, rain-proof roofs and stable foundations in architecture are more like constraints on creativity than typical objectives that are pursued for their own sake. Just as all organisms must reproduce, so in architecture must the building be functional and safe. Innovation in these worlds usually means f i nding new ways to respect the same old constraints that were present from the beginning. So even though the constraints do matter, the overall search is still driving towards uncharted spaces.*

**I'd say that the same applies to software. There are many constraints but there's still an infinite amount of ways to build something. Objectives lead to deception, constraints focuses you. 

---
Page: 95

*Some steps on this road are rejections of previous steps while others are ref i nements or distortions. But the important point is that no one knows or plans their masterwork by trying to predict at the outset what those future twists and turns may hold. Each innovation is interesting in its own right, regardless of where it leads. At the same time, the potential to lead somewhere even more novel is often the tell-tale sign of healthy innovation. Expressionism wasn’t captivating just for the paintings crafted in its style, but for the future possibilities it created.*

**Getting to a stepping stone is like unlocking a branch in a talent tree. Some stepping stones unlocks way more branches than others. Some stepping stones also requires way more resources to get to. Every unlock also has very path dependent reactions and counterreactions to it. It's very dynamic.

Page: 97

*When you think about abandoning objectives, it might seem particularly diff i cult to follow through because no one wants to wander aimlessly through the world.
Without objectives, the only remaining options might appear random or pointless.
In this context, you might think that doing nothing might be just as good as trying your best. But that would be to misread the deeper implications of this book. All of us have an uncanny instinct for sniff i ng potential wherever it might lead. That very human skill does not require an objective, which is why freeing ourselves from this objective straitjacket does not mean living life randomly. On the contrary, it should give our lives new meaning.*

**How deep down should you dive into rabbit holes? Not diving deep enough won't lead to anything interesting, diving too deep runs the risk of wasting more time than necessary. Do you really waste time though? Are there dead ends in non-objective searches?

*Out in the vast wilderness of the unknown are countless treasures buried deep in unmarked locations. All these treasures are worth f i nding even though none of them may be something you’re seeking in particular. But if you’re lucky enough to f i nd one, it comes with a bonus—a map of clues pointing to even more treasures.
That’s the stepping stone principle—one good idea leads to another. Treasures lead to more treasures, chaining and branching out across the inf i nite stepping stones of possible discoveries.*

**This is another formulation of The Adjacent Possible.

*interesting can mean a lot of things, whether it’s a love for something like music or writing, or a desire to explore the world. The important thing is that the scent of interestingness can lead each of us across our own chains of stepping stones. As with novelty, one interesting thing leads to another. Where they will lead can’t be predicted, but as long as we follow that scent, something worth f i nding is almost certain to turn up sooner or later.*

**This is the feeling I got when I watched Jeff Who Lives at Home. It's about listening to all the cues the world gives you and being ready to act.

---
Page: 100

*So if you want to be a treasure hunter without a specif i c objective, then there is a special kind of clue—when something feels interesting. That may sound simple, but the lesson behind it is deeper. It means that you can go treasure hunting by following your instinct for the interesting, not because you know where you’re going, but because you feel the potential in where you are right now. Even just accepting that this treasure-hunting approach makes sense is important. It opposes so many of the messages we receive today from our culture that say you need an objective to achieve anything worthwhile.*

**In Creative Confidence they tell us that doing is completely different from trying. If you try to do something you are baking in the assumption that you will fail and you half-ass it. Another example of this is in The Matrix when Neo is asked to jump between buildings for the first time.

Page: 102

*That isn’t to say that ambitious objectives can never be achieved. Sometimes frustrating old objectives do suddenly slip into range after suff i cient ideas and innovations accumulate. For example, f l ying machines were an ambitious objective for centuries before the Wright brothers achieved f l ight. But it’s easy to be misled by this kind of story because the failed attempts of the past are often driven by objectives, while the real reason for later success is different. In the past, and even into the time of the Wright brothers, those who pursued f l ight were primarily motivated by the inspiring vision of claiming the skies. Interestingly, Samuel Langly, their primary rival, attracted signif i cant government funding to match the ambition of his effort, compared to the meager self-f i nancing of the Wright brothers.
But the Wright brothers had a different kind of motivation. In fact, they were originally bicycle manufacturers. It turns out that for them bicycles were stepping stones to f l ying machines. You could say that they saw in the present an echo of the future, rather than trying to drag a preconceived vision of the future into the present.
So while f l ight was an objective for many failed visionaries over hundreds of years, it was when the bicycle-makers realized that planes are bicycles in the sky that it actually happened [105]. The moral is that just because an ambitious objective is ultimately achieved does not mean that it was realized because it was an objective.
To believe that would be to believe in the myth of the objective.*

**How does one find adjacent stepping stones? How does one know if their idea is too far away to be worthwhile?

Page: 103

*Instead of judging every activity for its potential to succeed, we should judge our projects for their potential to spawn more projects. If we really behave as treasure hunters and stepping stone collectors, then the only important thing about a stepping stone is that it leads to more stepping stones, period. The worst stepping stone is one that leads nowhere beyond itself, no matter how nice it may feel to stand upon it for the moment. As treasure hunters, our interest is in collecting more stepping stones, not in reaching a particular destination. The more stepping stones we f i nd, the more opportunities there are to depart to somewhere greater.*

**This heuristic prunes quite a lot of ideas. There are many ideas that is the end of the line, I.e they don't compose very well with other ideas or lend themselves to be deepened.

*Imagine the poverty of a Picbreeder on which all its users were searching for a butterf l y. Not only would there be almost nothing interesting on the site, but the crowning irony is that there would probably be no butterf l y either. We need to be careful not to model society in this misguided form.*

**If everybody's looking for the same thing, the stepping stones they find relevant will pretty much look the same.

Page: 107

*Creatures that are better adapted to their particular niche will tend to out-reproduce their less-adapted peers.
A gene that changes a rabbit’s fur to neon-yellow would make it easier to spot by predators, which might hurt the rabbit’s ability to survive. A gene like this probably wouldn’t spread throughout an entire population of rabbits because those rabbits carrying it would on average produce fewer offspring. On the other hand, a gene that makes a rabbit faster may enable it to better escape predators and increase its f i tness.*

**Ecosystems are fascinating, there's an infinite combinatoric relationship between the adjacent possible of different constellations of genes. It somehow ends up as a complete puzzle where everything's balanced out. What is that balance? There are limits to the exploration. A rabbit can't become infinitely fast, for one there's the biodynamical constraints, but then there's the issue of ecosystem collapse. As rabbits get faster, all their predators die, they eat too much of the food and wreak havoc on the very substrate they depend on.

*But natural evolution isn’t like these kinds of competitions because it drives towards divergence, towards a multitude of varying solutions to life’s problems. As in other examples of non-objective search, it’s exactly this accumulating and branching through the space of stepping stones that leads to the most impressive discoveries.*

**This reminds me of the space filling property of the networks that Geoffrey West talk about in Scale.

*If a mutation devastates an organism’s f i tness then the mutation will almost certainly disappear from the world quickly. On the other hand, mutations that don’t much affect f i tness have more uncertain fates, because natural selection will be mostly indifferent towards them. These kinds of neutral genetic changes evolve not by natural selection, but according to aimless genetic drift*

**It feels obvious now but I never considered neutral mutations.

*So it’s possible to view the creativity of evolution not as the product of competition, but rather as escape from competition. When stif l ing constraints on survival are lifted, the search can plow uninhibited through the search space, drifting and exapting its way to new stepping stones. Through this force for diversity, evolution gradually accumulates novelty. It’s just another non-objective process— what it ultimately produces was not set as an objective from the start—just like Picbreeder, human innovation, and novelty search. Though on the surface they seem different, the push for diversity in all these systems is aided by the non-objective stepping stone collector—the treasure hunter strikes again.*

**I had previously thought that the diversity we see is due to competition. I'm prepared to accept that it might not be that way. In evolutionary algorithms, does selection pressure even make sense? Does it have any benefits?

*Seen this way, evolution is a special kind of non-objective search: a minimal criteria search. It isn’t heading anywhere in particular, but it heads everywhere that passes the minimal criteria of survival and reproduction, which was satisf i ed from the very start of evolution by the f i rst reproducing cell. Evolution is just accumulating all the different ways to survive and reproduce. And as all the simple means of living are exhausted by the search, gradually more complex ones are uncovered. But they aren’t discovered because they are better or more optimal— they are simply the stepping stones reachable from where the search last stood.
The minimal criteria spill just f l ows onward. Once again, it is because there is no objective that evolution is so prolif i c: An objective would simply cut off more of the search space. In fact, this insight that evolution is a kind of minimal criteria search led us to invent a variation on the novelty search algorithm, called minimal criteria novelty search. This new algorithm was able to produce robot behaviors that solve mazes that even novelty search could not solve: It did so by searching for maze runners that found novel ways to do the same thing [56]. What’s interesting about this result is that it shows how high-level abstraction led to insights that could be tested as a practical automated spill-f i lling algorithm.*

**Is there a limit to complexity?

**Will evolution find stuff that's not just variations of the same thing? Will we see another kind of cell? Is machine life just another branch of evolution?

*So if we’re interested in the creativity of the process, it’s not unreasonable to abstract competition entirely out of evolution.
The problem with competition is that it introduces the concept of objective pressure to be better, which as we’ve seen can lead both to convergence and deception. Put another way, evolution is creative despite the competition it tolerates—not because of competition. For example, on Gentle Earth (where there is no competition) evolution would be even more creative.
So for evolution to produce impressive products it’s critical that competition doesn’t overpower the drive towards creativity. It’s important that the task of surviving and reproducing in natural evolution is a general, open-ended constraint.*

**Optimization has some creative value. We value master pieces because they are better than their competitors. They are objectively better, which reminds me of Deutsch's idea about objective beauty.

*Then how is local competition different? As f i rst highlighted by famed biologist Sewell Wright, local competition crafts and adapts organisms within their own niches, but only produces limited effects between niches [119]. The result is that unlike global competition, local competition encourages the founding of new niches to escape competition. In discovering a new way to live that’s free from previous competitors, competition is reduced—by running away from it. But in global competition there is no escape: No matter what an organism does it will always be judged against all others. That’s why global competition naturally leads to convergence while local competition naturally enhances diversity and creativity. So the idea of (localized) competition can be folded into the non-objective abstraction:
Natural evolution can be seen as a novelty-generating search with local competition.*

**This applies to markets too. Blue ocean strategy is about creating new markets and monopolizing them.

*It’s precisely because evolution has no overriding objective that it was able to discover something like humanity, precisely because it wasn’t looking for us that humanity was found. The paradox of objectives unif i es all large-scale open-ended creative systems—from human innovation that’s driven by our own intelligence and exploration of the interesting, to natural evolution with its notable lack of human guidance or design.*

**Selective breeding is a way to direct evolution. We can set constraints and let evolution do its thing.

*Importantly, these two heuristics hold a profound sway over the f i eld. Even if you don’t like them or have your own philosophy, you won’t publish many of your ideas without respecting them. In the f i eld of AI, the gatekeepers who decide what is published wield these heuristics with an iron f i st. If an algorithm doesn’t improve performance or doesn’t come with guarantees, it will be hard for it to pass the gatekeepers—and so it will probably never become known to the AI community as a whole. As a result, the two main heuristics of the AI community have a huge impact on which ideas are explored.*

**I wonder if GPT turns out to be a dead end. What would be annoying with that is that it's grabbing a lot of mindshare right now. Lots of other less performant techniques will probably suffer.

*The root of the problem is that the experimentalist heuristic is driven by an objective, which as usual stif l es exploration. In this case, the unstated objective is perfect performance, and all new algorithms are measured against it. If they seem to improve performance even a little bit, algorithms are rewarded with exposure and adoption. But if they fail to inch performance forward, they’re dismissed and ignored. The result is that the f i eld of AI is drawn into a classic objective-driven search—which is fueled by the assumption that objective-driven searches work well.
But there’s an interesting irony here: The experimentalist heuristic is driven by such a simple objective that few AI researchers would actually employ an algorithm based on such a naïve heuristic today.*

**Given that there are so many that are fooled by the myth of the objective, there ought to be quite a lot of arbitrage to be had by assuming it's false.
