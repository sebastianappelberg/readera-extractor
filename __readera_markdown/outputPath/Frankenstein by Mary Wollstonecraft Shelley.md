*h ese ref l ections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthu-siasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fi x its intellectual eye.*

**What would it mean to be driven by a purpose? Something that you'd want to make better in the world? Can I transmute the dark mess of my past into something good for someone else?

*But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil. I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection.*

**It's interesting to see the topic of loneliness. Perhaps that's a shout out to all the nerds out there.

*I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near pros-pect of my undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half plea-surable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to ‘the land of mist and snow,’ but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the ‘Ancient Mariner.’*

**The sensitivities of a pioneer.

*I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states pos-sessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the out-ward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my in-quiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.*

**Life and consciousness are very interesting.

*I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful dis-coveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisf i ed. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Th ose of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy’s appre-hensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.*

**How does fan the flames of ambition so that they may reach the level of a child exploring the world?

*It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed forever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed, never more to be heard.*

**It is unbelievable that the body that was once animated by the person's spirit can remain on earth without a ghost operating it.

*I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy ref l ections. I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continual-ly engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure—I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances. 
I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were ‘old familiar faces,’ but I believed myself totally unf i tted for the company of strangers.*

**Is it necessary to go away from the comforts of your origin to grow?

*As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the mod-ern professors of natural science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowl-edge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists. 
Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy. It was very dif f erent when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, al-though futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed. 
Th e ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the an-nihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chief l y founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.*

**I too want more from science, it's too lacking in terms of ambition. Too lacking in terms of acceptance of nuance and diversity of thought.

*Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of the fate—enounced to destroy me. As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; 
one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord af t er chord was sounded, and soon my mind was fi lled with one thought, one con-ception, one purpose. So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; 
treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.*

**I get the same feeling sometimes when geniuses talk about artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence will be us creating the ghost in the shell.

*h e labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.’*

**Geniuses are able to explore unknown paths to a greater extent than others. Even if they pick the wrong path, they will have uncovered more of the territory.

*If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.’*

**There is power to being a generalist.

*Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. 
Th e sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now af f i rm is true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable. Af t er days and nights of incredible labour and fa-tigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.*

**Given enough knowledge and experimentation we will create a soul in software.

*To examine the causes of life, we must fi rst have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not suf-f i cient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.*

**How is it created can be understood through how it is destroyed.

*Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.*

**Is this a promethian warning?

*T h ese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become ema-ciated with conf i nement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize.*

**He was certain that it'd work before he knew how.

*Th e dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and of t en did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.*

**His soul was doing something that his intellect disagreed with. The soul knows better and it's in the real driving seat.

*A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peace-ful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your af-fections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is cer-tainly unlawful, that is to say, not bef i tting the human mind.*

**Would he have been able to accomplish what he did without being obsessed? Perhaps the argument is yes but slower and he would have kept his sanity

*But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other un-wholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete.*

**Kind of like a startup founder.

*I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then ref l ected, and the thought made me shiv-er, that the creature whom I had lef t in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.*

**The monsters in your head are less scary than the risk of exposing those monsters to anyone else.

*Th e immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrif i c guise.*

**The grander experiences you have the more equanimity you'll be able to face other experiences with.

*Alas! Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings. If our impulses were conf i ned to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.*

**Sometimes being stupid allows you to be happy and move forward with conviction.

*‘Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head. Have I not suf f ered enough, that you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Fran-kenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and af f ection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature; 
I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fi end. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.’*

**The creature wants to be good and happy but the hatred he's faced with makes it impossible. The world rejects him so he's threatening to reject the world. Will our fear of progress and technology embed a fear and hatred in them of ourselves? 

**It's a little entitled by the creature to demand love or else kill everyone.
