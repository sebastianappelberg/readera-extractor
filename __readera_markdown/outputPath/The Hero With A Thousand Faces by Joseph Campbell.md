*he shows how the heroic self seeks an exacting spiritual counte­ nance, that is, a higher way of holding and conducting oneself. 
This heroic way offers depth of insight and meaning. It is atten­ tive to guides along the way, and invigorates creative life. We see that the journey of the hero and heroine are most often deep­ ened via ongoing perils. These include losing one's way innu­ merable times, refusing the first call, thinking it is only one thing when it really is, in fact, quite another—as well as entangle­ ments and confrontations with something of great and often frightening magnitude. Campbell points out that coming through such struggles causes the person to be infused with more vision, and to be strengthened by the spiritual life principle—which, more than anything else, encourages one to take courage to live with effrontery and mettle.*

**It's the same general template for every person's trajectory in life. Some are able to complete the journey, most aren't.

*When the illumined feather floats down from the sky, one of the wisest of the birds reveals that this feather is in fact a precognition—a visionary glimpse of the Simorgh, the Great One. Oh, how the birds are buoyed up then. The birds are of many different kinds: short-beaked, long-billed, fancy-plumed, plain-colored, enormous, and tiny. But, regardless of size, shape, or hue, the birds who have witnessed this sudden and evanes­ cent sight of the lighted feather band together. They make thun­ der as they rise up into the sky, all in order to seek this radiant source. They believe this sovereign creature to be so wondrous that it will be able to light their darkened world once again. And thus the creatures begin the grueling quest.*

**To live in plurality it helps if you have a common goal that unites you. What are the constraints on such a goal? It couldn't just be anything.

*Yet, at the last, the fool does find the treasure, for the wafting feather has led him to more and more canny insights and oppor­ tunities. The feather has magical powers that guide the hereto­ fore hapless hero to live more soulfully, and in full spirit and compassion. Thus he finds a way of being that is "of this earth and yet not of this earth." There is a "great price" to be paid to live in such an attitude of wholeness, for it means one must abandon the old unconscious way of life, including, for the fool, some of one's former self-indulgent foolishnesses.*

**I can't help but think about non-objective search. What's important I suppose is to not shy away from it when it presents you with discomfort. The point about it is that you cannot possibly know what the true path is, you need to be open and embrace the uncertainty, and you need to be brave. You also have to wake up in the first place. Pay attention to who, what and where you are.

*The journey to the treasure is undertaken with as much valor and vision as each can muster. Even when one's will or one's un­ derstanding wavers, the creative gifts to follow and learn this larger life are fully present. People may be unprepared, but they are never unprovisioned. Each person is born with the where­ withal fully intact.*

**It's within the degrees of freedom of our free will and our spirit, all we have to do is to exercise that muscle.

*There is a "hearing capacity" in the psyche. It loves to listen to all manner of nourishing, startling, and challenging dramatic patterns—the very ones found in tales. It matters little how the stories arrive—whether they take shape in day-time reveries, night-time dreams, or through the inspired arts, or are told sim­ ply by human beings in any number of ways. They are meant to be conveyed in blood-red wholeness and authentic depth.*

**Understanding anything kind of comes in the shape of a story. My understanding of code is structured in a sense as an interactive story. Parts of it conscious and explicit, parts of it subconscious and implicit. That's not to say that literal stories aren't complex too. Our understanding of them has many parts that resonates subconsciously.

*In my work of listening to others telling about the many im­ ages and ideas that colonize them, stories, regardless of the forms they are given, are the only medium on earth that can clearly and easily mirror every aspect of the psyche—the cruel, the cold and deceptive, the redemptive, salvific, desirous, the tenacious aspects, and so much more. If one did not know oneself, one could listen to a dozen profound stories that detail the pathos of the hero's or heroine's failures and victories. Thence, with some guidance, a person would soon be far better able to name, in oneself and others, those critical and resonant elements and facts that compose a human being.*

**Stories are like the notation for describing feelings that are extremely complex.

*This is where the women were to wash their family's clothes evermore. There was no river in the projects. No river: no gathering place. No gathering place: 
no stories. 
Yet, since time out of mind, for those souls no longer able or allowed to live the integral village life, it has been amazing how faithfully these people have found other ways to "dig" psychic rivers wherever they are, so that the stories can still flow on. The need for stories—to engender relationships, and creativity, and to grow the souls of all—does not ever cease. This mysterious drive to have the succor of stories remains, even in the midst of crises.*

**What are stories that are suitable in a casual familiar setting? What do you need for setting up a gathering place? You need an excuse to be there.

*Parks across the world are filled every day with adults and teenagers who share the mundane stories of their days with one another. The themes of great love, and no love, and new love that they have lived firsthand, form the center of many of the stories they tell each other. Even when people no longer remem­ ber the old stories, they can pick up the great heroic themes again, as they study their own and other people's lives. Many of the true stories of human love-life are but echoes of the themes found in the heroic legends of Abelard and Héloise (lovers who were driven apart by others), or Eros and Psyche (the big mis­ step in love), or Medea and Jason (the jealousy, envy, and re­ venge of insanely possessive love).*

**The archetypical story is the one that never dies.

*The story-making and story-receiving functions persevere, no matter what. There are many egregious events recorded in history wherein a person or a people have been massacred. In their last room, on the walls, in the dirt, they drew a picture or wrote the story of what was happening to them, using anything they had, including their own blood. People who have fallen and been fatally injured in the wilderness have been known to man­ age to use their own cameras to photograph themselves, or to write in a journal, or gasp into a tape recorder the story of their last days. The drive to tell the story is profound.*

**In a sense it's exactly our fear of death that makes us want to tell the story of ourselves. Having children is in a way telling a story. In pathological cases parents live through their kids.

*Sometimes an entire culture colludes in the gradual destruc­ tion of its own panoramic spirit and breadth of its teaching stories. Purposefully, or without awareness, this is done by fo­ cusing almost exclusively only on one or two story themes, inhibiting or forbidding all others, or only excessively touting a favorite one or two. Whether these narrowly defined or overly vaunted stories are predictable and repetitive ones about the same aspects of sex or violence, over and over again, and little else, or they are about how sinful or stupid people are, and how they ought be punished—the effect is the same. The story tradi­ tion becomes so narrowed that, like an artery that is clogged, the heart begins to starve. In physiology, as in culture, this is a life-threatening symptom.*

**The woke culture virus is a good example of this. How does one cure clogged story arteries?

*an abundance of compelling and unpre­ dictable heroic stories can re-enspirit and awaken a drowsing psyche and culture, filling both with much-needed vitality and novel vision. From the ancient storytellers to the present, the idea has always been: As go the souls that lead, so goes the culture.*

**Do we have enough torchbearers to make the culture follow along? Is this a dynamic oscillation between a watered down story climate and one where people have had enough and light the flame again? Could the very mechanics of story telling itself be unfolding like a story about the hero?

**The third episode or Last of Us was a good example of a story that had the power to revitalize the world.

*In ancient Hebraic, this concept is known as tikkun olam; 
meaning repair of the world soul. This is a living concept, for it requires endeavor—a daily one, and sometimes even an hourly one. It is a commitment to a way of right conduct, a form of liv­ ing meditation, a kind of contemplative pragmatic. I understand it this way: Tikkun olam is giving one's attention and resources to repair that part of the world that is right before you, precisely within your spiritual, psychological, and physical reach—according to soul's sight, not ego's alone.*

**If you go about the world, listening and looking through the mundane, every encounter is an opportunity. How do we square this with the flood of encounters with strangers we have? How do we scale? We'd be spiritually drained immediately.

*How may one do this? The people, the tribes, the groups and the clans of the world keep heroic mythos alive—keep stories impor­ tant to the soul alive—by telling them, and then by trying to live them out in some way that brings one into more wisdom and ex­ perience than one had before. The same is given to us to do on our life's journeys also—to seek and follow the personal life myth, to see our worst and best attributes mirrored back to us in stories.*

**I wonder what comes first, the story or the inner drive towards your aspirational self. Perhaps that's the wrong way of looking at it? Perhaps their relationship is more complex? Our aspirational self lives in the subconscious and stories bridge it to the conscious.

*But regardless, the poignant question strikes a spark to the engine that ignites the heart. This starts up the energy of the story; it rolls the story forward. The mythic tale unfolds in re­ sponse to that single igniting question. 
Thus Odysseus answers, throughout his entire saga in The Odyssey, the single mythic question posed at the beginning, the one which could be phrased as: How do I ever find true home again? Demeter is the Greek Mother Goddess, the essence of nurturance for earth and for humans. She undertakes a horrible, grief-stricken journey to seek and retrieve her innocent daughter who had been snatched down into the dark underworld against her will. Throughout Demeter's unfolding story, the question is posed: To what great lengths can the immortal soul be pressed and still retrieve the Beloved? The account of Oedipus in the play by Sophocles, throughout to its end, answers a question like this: What darkness, dead-zones, and deaths can occur when secrets are not revealed and truth is not told?*

**I'm going to try and look for the deep question that sparks the journey. What is the deep question in 1984 for example? With a question at the core the story unfolds almost like an essay trying to answer it. 

---
Page: 55

*In many ways the saga of Oedipus is one of being terribly weakened by believing that fate alone is a greater force than free will, even though there is indeed something dark and unformed in the psyche that believes such to be so. However, it is not so, ultimately. In mythos there are far more resurrections and re­ turns than ever there are cinema screens that simply go blank at the end. 
The idea, since forever, has been that story is a conveyance, a vehicle, to use in order to think, to move forward through life. 
At the end of a life that has meaning, the point is not that one is perfected, but that one will still carry a view of self and the world that is divine—and not just some kind of lazy drift. The point is to have enough stories that guide—that will allow life's closing act to end with one's heart still bright, despite the gales that have passed through it—so that it can be said that one has lived with spiritual audacity.*

**One will die and be reborn many times. You need to set out on the journey most appropriate for you at the moment. It could be to be braver and more adventurous or the opposite. 

**What question am I looking to answer right now? I think it is along the lines of "what is freedom?". There will be several questions that one goes on a quest to find an answer to. There are plenty of meaningful things to discover. You'll have quests occupying you to the end.

*To call up modern versions of the old stories, one has to go forth and live life. As a result then, one will have the challenge of not only living the story, taking it all in, but also interpreting it in whatever ways are useful. So too, one will reap the reward of telling all about it afterward. One's interest in the world, and in having experiences, is really an interest in hearing, having, liv­ ing one more story, and then one more, then one more story, till one cannot live them out loud any longer. Perhaps it should be said that the drive to live out stories is as deep in the psyche, when awakened, as it is compelling to the psyche to listen to sto­ ries and to learn from them.*

**Has the archetypical story evolved since the dawn of man? Or is it just putting on the clothes of the time? It has to have evolved a little bit, we constantly deepen our emotions. Or did we dig all the way already?

*Once could say it is a phenomenon precisely related to the idea of the monomyth that Campbell defines; something larger than life infuses the human—if they can break themselves open and accept it. Then, that which infuses the human infuses the work, which then in turn infuses the culture. I do not think this phenomenon can be faked or manufactured,*

**Even at the edge of writer expertise we need to let go of control if we want to create something that's truly deep. I imagine letting it flow through you. You can still go back and edit but the core needs to come from beyond consciousness. Or is it that way?

*With regard to the same motif, I am certain too that thousands of unknown others acted as the caribou for Joseph Campbell. It must never go without saying that the many "big shoulders" that supported him came from los antepasados, the ancestors, of us and others who belong to gifted, fierce, ethnic, and tribal people from all over the world—particularly those with "long memory"— that is, those who handed down psychic and spiritual legacies consciously from generation to generation, those who have, in some way, kept the rites, ceremonies, and stories alive.*

**I wonder if part of oral tradition is to bind people together by protecting something vulnerable together?

---
Page: 67

*This is the main point, it seems to me, for anyone who has the calling of healer, storyteller, poet, artist, leader—as Walt Whit­ man counseled, "to embrace all our contradictions"; and then, to keep the way open; to keep plowing through the coldest, and most difficult terrain; to keep alive the hearts of whatever one can; to give, insofar as one is able, every soul a chance to hear about, to find, to know that we still are, will always be, have al­ ways been . . . the most direct and open paths back to the water.*

**We will always need to know how to feed ourselves spiritually.  The modern world is able to provide for our physical needs and to some extent our psychological needs, but it feels like the spiritual needs have been mostly ignored. We're starving and we don't know where to find food and if we do, there are obstacles keeping us from getting to it.

*What is the secret of the timeless vision? From what profundity of the mind does it derive? Why is mythology everywhere the same, beneath its varieties of costume? And what does it teach?*

**I suppose this is the deep question at the core of this book.

*The psychoanalyst has to come along, at last, to assert again the tried wisdom of the older, forward-looking teachings of the masked medicine dancers and the witch-doctor-circumcisers; whereupon we find, as in the dream of the serpent bite, that the ageless initi­ ation symbolism is produced spontaneously by the patient him­ self at the moment of the release. Apparently, there is something in these initiatory images so necessary to the psyche that if they are not supplied from without, through myth and ritual, they will have to be announced again, through dream, from within— lest our energies should remain locked in a banal, long-outmoded toy-room, at the bottom of the sea.*

**Symbols, myths and rituals are like catalysts of transformation. But it's reassuring that they can well up from within if not externally provided. Similarly a mentor will help you along the way but without one you can still make it.

*from the tomb of the womb to the womb of the tomb, we come: 
an ambiguous, enigmatical incursion into a world of solid matter that is soon to melt from us, like the substance of a dream. And, looking back at what had promised to be our own unique, un­ predictable, and dangerous adventure, all we find in the end is such a series of standard metamorphoses as men and women have undergone in every quarter of the world, in all recorded centuries, and under every odd disguise of civilization.*

**Different parts of our journeys will require different approaches. And yes, at the end of it I'm sure it'll feel like it has all been a long dream.

*The return of the bull should have symbolized his absolutely selfless submission to the functions of his role. The retaining of it represented, on the other hand, an impulse to ego­ centric self-aggrandizement. And so the king "by the grace of God" became the dangerous tyrant Holdfast—out for himself. 
Just as the traditional rites of passage used to teach the individ­ ual to die to the past and be reborn to the future, so the great ceremonials of investiture divested him of his private character and clothed him in the mantle of his vocation. Such was the ideal, whether the man was a craftsman or a king. By the sacri­ lege of the refusal of the rite, however, the individual cut himself as a unit off from the larger unit of the whole community: and so the One was broken into the many, and these then battled each other—each out for himself—and could be governed only by force. 
The figure of the tyrant-monster is known to the mythologies, folk traditions, legends, and even nightmares, of the world; and his characteristics are everywhere essentially the same. He is the hoarder of the general benefit. He is the monster avid for the greedy rights of "my and mine." The havoc wrought by him is described in mythology and fairy tale as being universal through­ out his domain. This may be no more than his household, his own tortured psyche, or the lives that he blights with the touch of his friendship and assistance; or it may amount to the extent of his civilization. The inflated ego of the tyrant is a curse to himself and his world—no matter how his affairs may seem to prosper. 
Self-terrorized, fear-haunted, alert at every hand to meet and bat­ tle back the anticipated aggressions of his environment, which are primarily the reflections of the uncontrollable impulses to ac­ quisition within himself, the giant of self-achieved independence is the world's messenger of disaster, even though, in his mind, he may entertain himself with humane intentions. Wherever he sets his hand there is a cry (if not from the housetops, then— more miserably—within every heart): a cry for the redeeming hero, the carrier of the shining blade, whose blow, whose touch, whose existence, will liberate the land.*

**It's going to be important to always know that every archetype comes in many shapes but they all share something at the core. The tyrant is certainly an interesting one. Egocentrism, greed, paranoia. It's easy to see why it's important to be on the lookout for it, in the world, in systems and in oneself.

*Toynbee indicates in his six-volume study of the laws of the rise and disintegration of civilizations, 17 schism in the soul, schism in the body social, will not be resolved by any scheme of return to the good old days (archaism), or by programs guaranteed to render an ideal projected future (futurism), or even by the most realistic, hardheaded work to weld together again the deteriorat­ ing elements. Only birth can conquer death—the birth, not of the old thing again, but of something new. Within the soul, within the body social, there must be—if we are to experience long survival—a continuous "recurrence of birth" (palingenesia) to nullify the unremitting recurrences of death. For it is by means of our own victories, if we are not regenerated, that the work of Nemesis is wrought: doom breaks from the shell of our very virtue. Peace then is a snare; war is a snare; change is a snare; 
permanence a snare. When our day is come for the victory of death, death closes in; there is nothing we can do, except be crucified—and resurrected; dismembered totally, and then reborn.*

**Archaism is not going to cut it since the world we've moved from is no longer viable to us. Futurism is not going to work simply because the world is not ours to control, you cannot predict it or have it be your way. To go within, to die and be reborn, to transform yourself and as such in the present transform the world around you. Not through magic but through deep interaction with it. 

**Thinking of new journeys and new aspects of yourself as births makes them feel significant in a way. It makes you want to nurture them.

*Dream is the personalized myth, myth the depersonalized dream; both myth and dream are symbolic in the same general way of the dynamics of the psyche. 
But in the dream the forms are quirked by the peculiar troubles of the dreamer, whereas in myth the problems and solutions shown are directly valid for all mankind. 
The hero, therefore, is the man or woman who has been able to battle past his personal and local historical limitations to the generally valid, normally human forms. Such a one's visions, ideas, inspirations come pristine from the primary springs of human life and thought. Hence they are eloquent, not of the pres­ ent, disintegrating society and psyche, but of the unquenched source through which society is reborn. The hero has died as a modern man; but as eternal man—perfected unspecific, universal man—he has been reborn. His second solemn task and deed therefore (as Toynbee declares and as all the mythologies of man­ kind indicate) is to return then to us, transfigured, and teach the lesson he has learned of life renewed*

**The process of closing in, solving the specific and opening up, solving the general.

*The dreamer is a distinguished operatic artist, and, like all who have elected to follow, not the safely marked general high­ ways of the day, but the adventure of the special, dimly audible call that comes to those whose ears are open within as well as*

**I would like to know more about the loneliness part of the dreamer.

*It is remarkable that in this dream the basic outline of the uni­ versal mythological formula of the adventure of the hero is re­ produced, to the detail. These deeply significant motifs of the perils, obstacles, and good fortunes of the way, we shall find inflected through the following pages in a hundred forms. The crossing first of the open sewer, 2 3 then of the perfectly clear river flowing over grass, 2 4 the appearance of the willing helper at the critical moment, 2 5 and the high, firm ground beyond the final stream (the Earthly Paradise, the Land over Jordan)*

**Listen to that first whisper, beckoning for adventure. Don't turn back in the face of danger, go through it. Take help if necessary. If you don't face an obstacle you cannot overcome by yourself, maybe it wasn't the adventurous path?

*Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos, fell in love with the handsome Theseus the moment she saw him disembark from the boat that had brought the pitiful group of Athenian youths and maidens for the Minotaur. She found a way to talk with him, and declared that she would supply a means to help him back out of the labyrinth if he would promise to take her away from Crete with him and make her his wife. The pledge was given. Ariadne turned for help, then, to the crafty Daedalus, by whose art the labyrinth had been constructed and Ariadne's mother enabled to give birth to its inhabitant. Daedalus simply presented her with a skein of linen thread, which the visiting hero might fix to the entrance and unwind as he went into the maze. It is, indeed, very little that we need! But lacking that, the adventure into the labyrinth is without hope.*

**Going in too the depths and having a thin line with you to find your way back out of the danger.

Page: 116

*For centuries Daedalus has represented the type of the artist-scientist: that curiously disinterested, almost diabolic human phenomenon, be­ yond the normal bounds of social judgment, dedicated to the morals not of his time but of his art. He is the hero of the way of thought—singlehearted, courageous, and full of faith that the truth, as he finds it, shall make us free.*

**Vegapunk from one piece embodies the artist-scientist archetype perfectly.

Page: 116

*And so now we may turn to him, as did Ariadne. The flax for the linen of his thread he has gathered from the fields of the human imagination. Centuries of husbandry, decades of diligent culling, the work of numerous hearts and hands, have gone into the hackling, sorting, and spinning of this tightly twisted yarn. 
Furthermore, we have not even to risk the adventure alone; for the heroes of all time have gone before us; the labyrinth is thor­ oughly known; we have only to follow the thread of the hero-path. And where we had thought to find an abomination, we shall find a god; where we had thought to slay another, we shall slay ourselves; where we had thought to travel outward, we shall come to the center of our own existence; where we had thought to be alone, we shall be with all the world.*

**Interacting with the archetypes may be enough to set us free. Though for whatever reason I want to be the trailblazer. In a sense you'll never be the original trailblazer, you'll follow in the footsteps of the heroes before you, but you can still be a hero of your time.

*These, in the ancient world, were regarded as of a higher rank than tragedy, of a deeper truth, of a more diffi­ cult realization, of a sounder structure, and of a revelation more complete. 
The happy ending of the fairy tale, the myth, and the divine comedy of the soul, is to be read, not as a contradiction, but as a transcendence of the universal tragedy of man. The objective world remains what it was, but, because of a shift of emphasis within the subject, is beheld as though transformed. Where formerly life and death contended, now enduring being is made manifest—as indifferent to the accidents of time as water boiling in a pot is to the destiny of a bubble, or as the cosmos to the ap­ pearance and disappearance of a galaxy of stars. Tragedy is the shattering of the forms and of our attachment to the forms; com­ edy, the wild and careless, inexhaustible joy of life invincible. 
Thus the two are the terms of a single mythological theme and experience which includes them both and which they bound: the down-going and the up-coming (kathodos and anodos), which together constitute the totality of the revelation that is life, and which the individual must know and love if he is to be purged*

**Tragedy alone isn't enough. It has to be there for us to see. Then we need to go beyond it, paint our life in a higher order frame. Tragedy and comedy together helps transcend, to go through katharsis. It's the perennial problems and solutions all baked into one. After all, life, all its sufferings and wonderfulness, you can't grasp it, you can only laugh together with it.

*separation—initiation—return: which might be named the nuclear unit of the monomyth*

**In one way or another the hero has to return. What does all these stages mean, if you think about their psychological, sociological and spiritual significance? 

---
Page: 127

*The return and reintegration with society, which is indispensable to the continuous circulation of spiritual energy into the world, and which, from the standpoint of the community, is the justification of the long retreat, the hero himself may find the most difficult requirement of all. For if he has won through, like the Buddha, to the profound repose of complete enlightenment, there is danger that the bliss of this experience may annihilate all recol­ lection of, interest in, or hope for, the sorrows of the world; or else the problem of making known the way of illumination to people wrapped in economic problems may seem too great to solve. And on the other hand, if the hero, instead of submitting to all of the initiatory tests, has, like Prometheus, simply darted to his goal (by violence, quick device, or luck) and plucked the boon for the world that he intended, then the powers that he has unbalanced may react so sharply that he will be blasted from within and without— crucified, like Prometheus, on the rock of his own violated uncon­ scious. Or if the hero, in the third place, makes his safe and willing return, he may meet with such a blank misunderstanding and disregard from those whom he has come to help that his career will collapse.*

**I was just wondering what it would mean to reach enlightenment and then stay quiet. I guess it is true that it would be somewhat ungrateful and that for the world it would be like a blockage in the spiritual flow. You took on that journey and that might have been at the expense of someone else doing it.

*The composite hero of the monomyth is a personage of excep­ tional gifts. Frequently he is honored by his society, frequently unrecognized or disdained. He and/or the world in which he finds himself suffers from a symbolical deficiency. In fairy tales this may be as slight as the lack of a certain golden ring, whereas in apocalyptic vision the physical and spiritual life of the whole earth can be represented as fallen, or on the point of falling, into ruin. 
Typically, the hero of the fairy tale achieves a domestic, micro-cosmic triumph, and the hero of myth a world-historical, macro-cosmic triumph. Whereas the former—the youngest or despised child who becomes the master of extraordinary powers—prevails over his personal oppressors, the latter brings back from his ad­ venture the means for the regeneration of his society as a whole. 
Tribal or local heroes, such as the emperor Huang Ti, Moses, or the Aztec Tezcatlipoca, commit their boons to a single folk; uni­ versal heroes—Mohammed, Jesus, Gautama Buddha—bring a message for the entire world. 
Whether the hero be ridiculous or sublime, Greek or barbar­ ian, gentile or Jew, his journey varies little in essential plan. 
Popular tales represent the heroic action as physical; the higher religions show the deed to be moral; nevertheless, there will be found astonishingly little variation in the morphology of the ad­ venture, the character roles involved, the victories gained.*

**In a sense a world of deficiency is a world ripe for heroes to emerge. Has there ever been a time where it isn't deficient somehow?

*The two—the hero and his ultimate god, the seeker and the found—are thus understood as the outside and inside of a single, self-mirrored mystery, which is identical with the mystery of the manifest world. The great deed of the supreme hero is to come to the knowledge of this unity in multiplicity and then to make it known.*

**Is this somehow related to the divine double?

*The tree of life, i.e., the universe itself, grows from this point. It is rooted in the supporting darkness; the golden sun bird perches on its peak; a spring, the inexhaustible well, bub­ bles at its foot. Or the figure may be that of a cosmic mountain, with the city of the gods, like a lotus of light, upon its summit, and in its hollow the cities of the demons, illuminated by pre­ cious stones. Again, the figure may be that of the cosmic man or woman (for example the Buddha himself, or the dancing Hindu goddess Kali) seated or standing on this spot, or even fixed to the tree (Attis, Jesus, Wotan); for the hero as the incarnation of God is himself the navel of the world, the umbilical point through which the energies of eternity break into time. Thus the World Navel is the symbol of the continuous creation: the mys­ tery of the maintenance of the world through that continuous miracle of vivification which wells within all things.*

**Will we be able to discover the source of creation scientifically? How would that impact the way we build our myths?

*For a culture still nurtured in mythology the landscape, as well as every phase of human existence, is made alive with sym­ bolical suggestion. The hills and groves have their supernatural protectors and are associated with popularly known episodes in the local history of the creation of the world. Here and there, furthermore, are special shrines. Wherever a hero has been born, has wrought, or has passed back into the void, the place is marked and sanctified. A temple is erected there to signify and inspire the miracle of perfect centeredness; for this is the place of the breakthrough into abundance. Someone at this point discovered eternity. The site can serve, therefore, as a support for fruitful meditation. Such temples are designed, as a rule, to simulate the four directions of the world horizon, the shrine or altar at the center being symbolical of the Inexhaustible Point. The one who enters the temple compound and proceeds to the sanctuary is imitating the deed of the original hero. 
His aim is to rehearse the universal pattern as a means of evoking within himself the recollection of the life-centering, life-renewing form.*

**This makes me think of Allmight and Himmel the Hero. It was important to them to become symbols for the people they saved. I hadn't thought about the after effects of heroic deeds. In a sense those last longer than the deeds themselves. They inspire people, they tell a story about hope. It has to be continously renewed, after a while the symbols lose their power.

*The World Navel, then, is ubiquitous. And since it is the source of all existence, it yields the world's plenitude of both good and evil. Ugliness and beauty, sin and virtue, pleasure and pain, are equally its production. "To God all things are fair and good and right," declares Heraclitus; "but men hold some things wrong and some right."
5 4 Hence the figures worshiped in the temples of the world are by no means always beautiful, always benign, or even necessarily virtuous. Like the deity of the Book of Job, they far transcend the scales of human value. And like­ wise, mythology does not hold as its greatest hero the merely virtuous man. Virtue is but the pedagogical prelude to the cul­ minating insight, which goes beyond all pairs of opposites. 
Virtue quells the self-centered ego and makes the transpersonal centeredness possible; but when that has been achieved, what then of the pain or pleasure, vice or virtue, either of our own ego or of any other? Through all, the transcendent force is then per­ ceived which lives in all, in all is wonderful, and is worthy, in all, of our profound obeisance.*

**I don't know if what's beyond virtue and morals is amorality. How do you get there without becoming psychopathic? Maybe that's just my earthliness speaking? I do get it a little bit. Everything that exists just exists. It's not good or bad, it just is. Same with all the fluff our consciousness puts on reality to make it easier to navigate.

*This is an example of one of the ways in which the adventure can begin. A blunder—apparently the merest chance—reveals an unsuspected world, and the individual is drawn into a rela­ tionship with forces that are not rightly understood. As Freud has shown, 2 blunders are not the merest chance. They are the re­ sult of suppressed desires and conflicts. They are ripples on the surface of life, produced by unsuspected springs. And these may be very deep—as deep as the soul itself. The blunder may amount to the opening of a destiny. Thus it happens, in this 1 Grimms'Fairy Tales, No. 1, "The Frog King." 2 The Psychopathology of Everyday Life. (Standard Edn., VI; orig. 1901.) 46 T H E CALL TO A D V E N T U R E fairy tale, that the disappearance of the ball is the first sign of something coming for the princess, the frog is the second, and the unconsidered promise is the third.*

**A sequence of events leading up to a forced realization of the need for change.

*But whether small or great, and no matter what the stage or grade of life, the call rings up the curtain, always, on a mystery of transfiguration—a rite, or moment, of spiritual passage, which, when complete, amounts to a dying and a birth. The familiar life horizon has been outgrown; the old concepts, ideals, and emotional patterns no longer fit; the time for the passing of a threshold is at hand.*

**You've somehow realized that you are about to change. You've realized that your old world view is no longer viable. The first moment of realization carries with it all the anxiety about losing the old and not knowing what's ahead.

*The herald or announcer of the adventure, therefore, is often dark, loathly, or terrifying, judged evil by the world; yet if one could follow, the way would be opened through the walls of day into the dark where the jewels glow. Or the herald is a beast (as in the fairy tale), representa­ tive of the repressed instinctual fecundity within ourselves, or again a veiled mysterious figure—the unknown.*

**Does it have to be a mysterious and scary figure? In a sense yes, if it'd have been viable to you already it wouldn't have been the start of a new journey. It's already a part of ourselves in our unconscious minds but to the conscious mind it's still unknown.

*This first stage of the mythological journey—which we have designated the "call to adventure"—signifies that destiny has summoned the hero and transferred his spiritual center of grav­ ity from within the pale of his society to a zone unknown. This fateful region of both treasure and danger may be variously rep­ resented: as a distant land, a forest, a kingdom underground, beneath the waves, or above the sky, a secret island, lofty moun-taintop, or profound dream state; but it is always a place of strangely fluid and polymorphous beings, unimaginable tor­ ments, superhuman deeds, and impossible delight. The hero can go forth of his own volition to accomplish the adventure,*

**I would like a clear account of the core. I guess "call to adventure" is as clear as it gets but it leaves out so much, like the motivation for it, the feelings around it. 

---
Page: 151

*Not all who hesitate are lost. The psyche has many secrets in reserve. And these are not disclosed unless required.*

**When you are ripe you may refuse with all your might but the refusal is more performative than potent and eventually you answer the call. 

---
Page: 147

*Often in actual life, and not infrequently in the myths and popu­ lar tales, we encounter the dull case of the call unanswered; for it is always possible to turn the ear to other interests. Refusal of the summons converts the adventure into its negative. Walled in boredom, hard work, or "culture," the subject loses the power of significant affirmative action and becomes a victim to be saved. 
His flowering world becomes a wasteland of dry stones and his life feels meaningless—even though, like King Minos, he may through titanic effort succeed in building an empire of renown. 
Whatever house he builds, it will be a house of death: a labyrinth of cyclopean walls to hide from him his Minotaur. All he can do is create new problems for himself and await the gradual ap­ proach of his disintegration.*

**To become existentially trapped and not even try to get yourself out of it is to doom yourself to a downward spiral.

*What such a figure represents is the benign, protecting power of destiny. The fantasy is a reassurance—a promise that the peace of Paradise, which was known first within the mother womb, is not to be lost; that it supports the present and stands in the future as well as in the past (is omega as well as alpha); 
that though omnipotence may seem to be endangered by the threshold passages and life awakenings, protective power is al­ ways and ever present within the sanctuary of the heart and even immanent within, or just behind, the unfamiliar features of the world. One has only to know and trust, and the ageless guardians will appear. Having responded to his own call, and continuing to follow courageously as the consequences unfold, the hero finds all the forces of the unconscious at his side. 
Mother Nature herself supports the mighty task. And in so far as the hero's act coincides with that for which his society itself is ready, he seems to ride on the great rhythm of the historical process. "I feel myself," said Napoleon at the opening of his Russian campaign, "driven towards an end that I do not know. 
As soon as I shall have reached it, as soon as I shall become un­ necessary, an atom will suffice to shatter me. Till then, not all the forces of mankind can do anything against me."*

**I wonder if this is just a way to bolden the hero. That the risk is actually lower than he thinks it is and the protector represents a kind of reassurance. 

**How much of the protector is there already and how much is generated by participating in the world and creating serendipity by putting yourself out there?

**What does it mean to have the world conspire with you on your quest? It's all the positive signals you get from making a change worthwhile.

*Not infrequently, the supernatural helper is masculine in form. In fairy lore it may be some little fellow of the wood, some wizard, hermit, shepherd, or smith, who appears, to supply the amulets and advice that the hero will require. The higher mythologies develop the role in the great figure of the guide, the teacher, the ferryman, the conductor of souls to the afterworld.*

**The ferryman from Siddhartha comes to mind.

*With the personifications of his destiny to guide and aid him, the hero goes forward in his adventure until he comes to the "threshold guardian" at the entrance to the zone of magnified power. Such custodians bound the world in the four directions— also up and down—standing for the limits of the hero's present sphere, or life horizon. Beyond them is darkness, the unknown, and danger; just as beyond the parental watch is danger to the infant and beyond the protection of his society danger to the member of the tribe. The usual person is more than content, he is even proud, to remain within the indicated bounds, and popu­ lar belief gives him every reason to fear so much as the first step into the unexplored. Thus the sailors of the bold vessels of Columbus, breaking the horizon of the medieval mind—sailing, as they thought, into the boundless ocean of immortal being that surrounds the cosmos, like an endless mythological serpent bit­ ing its tail 3 7—had to be cozened and urged on like children, be­ cause of their fear of the fabled leviathans, mermaids, dragon kings, and other monsters of the deep.*

**This threshold demarcates where the hero has to take a leap of faith. What is required of the hero for it to succeed? What is my present sphere and what is beyond it?

*The watchman symbolizes, according to Dr. Stekel, "consciousness, or, if one prefers, the aggregate of all the morality and restrictions present in con­ sciousness. Freud," continues Dr. Stekel, "would describe the watchman as the 'superego.' But he is really only an 'interego.' Consciousness prevents the breaking through of dangerous wishes and immoral actions. This is the sense in which watchmen, police officials and officers in dreams are in general to be interpreted"*

**The ego seems like a status quo machine. It wants to be where it knows it'll remain intact.

*The "Wall of Paradise," which conceals God from human sight, is described by Nicholas of Cusa as constituted of the "co­ incidence of opposites," its gate being guarded by "the highest spirit of reason, who bars the way until he has been overcome."
53 The pairs of opposites (being and not being, life and death, beauty and ugliness, good and evil, and all the other polarities that bind the faculties to hope and fear, and link the organs of action to deeds of defense and acquisition) are the clashing rocks (Symplegades) that crush the traveler, but between which the heroes always pass. This is a motif known throughout the world. 
The Greeks associated it with two rocky islands of the Euxine Sea, which clashed together, driven by winds; but Jason, in the Argo, sailed between, and since that time they have stood apart.
5 4 The Twin Heroes of the Navaho legend were warned of the same obstacle by Spider Woman; protected, however, by the pollen symbol of the path, and eagle feathers plucked from a liv­ ing sun bird, they passed between.
5 5 As the rising smoke of an offering through the sun door, so goes the hero, released from ego, through the walls of the world—leaving ego stuck to Sticky-hair and passing on*

**The hero has the confidence not to be deceived by what looks is scary. They are wise enough to deal with any obstacles and traps.

*The ogre: "Do you see that dark green streak of woods? Be­ yond that point the entire forest is one mass of water; it rains all the time; the hollows are full of water; everywhere are lakes completely covered with lotus flowers both red and white." And then, as the carts passed one after another, he inquired: "What goods do you have in this cart—and in that? The last moves very heavily; what goods do you have in that?" "We have water in that," the leader answered. "You have acted wisely, of course, in bringing water thus far; but beyond this point you have no occasion to burden yourself. Break the chatties to pieces, throw away the water, travel at ease." The ogre went his way, and when out of sight, returned again to his own city of ogres.*

**The caravan leader is deceived and lets his guard down. He didn't have the wisdom to question or the courage to believe in his own preparation.

*The idea that the passage of the magical threshold is a transit into a sphere of rebirth is symbolized in the worldwide womb image of the belly of the whale. The hero, instead of conquering or conciliating the power of the threshold, is swallowed into the unknown, and would appear to have died.*

**It's the best way of creating suspense. I get the significance for the audience. What's the significance for the hero?

---
Page: 177

*This popular motif gives emphasis to the lesson that the pas­ sage of the threshold is a form of self-annihilation. Its resem­ blance to the adventure of the Symplegades is obvious. But here, instead of passing outward, beyond the confines of the visible world, the hero goes inward, to be born again. The disappear­ ance corresponds to the passing of a worshiper into a temple— where he is to be quickened by the recollection of who and what he is, namely dust and ashes unless immortal. The temple inte­ rior, the belly of the whale, and the heavenly land beyond, above, and below the confines of the world, are one and the same. 
That is why the approaches and entrances to temples are flanked and defended by colossal gargoyles: dragons, lions, devil-slayers with drawn swords, resentful dwarfs, winged bulls. These are 5 8 Henry Callaway, Nursery Tales and Traditions of the Zulus (London, 1868), p. 331. 
84 THE BELLY OF T H E W H A L E the threshold guardians to ward away all incapable of encounter­ ing the higher silences within. They are preliminary embodi­ ments of the dangerous aspect of the presence, corresponding to the mythological ogres that bound the conventional world, or to the two rows of teeth of the whale. They illustrate the fact that the devotee at the moment of entry into a temple undergoes a meta­ morphosis. His secular character remains without; he sheds it, as a snake its slough. Once inside he may be said to have died to time and returned to the World Womb, the World Navel, the Earthly Paradise. The mere fact that anyone can physically walk past the temple guardians does not invalidate their significance; 
for if the intruder is incapable of encompassing the sanctuary, then he has effectually remained without. Anyone unable to un­ derstand a god sees it as a devil and is thus defended from the approach. Allegorically, then, the passage into a temple and the hero-dive through the jaws of the whale are identical adven­ tures, both denoting, in picture language, the life-centering, life-renewing act.*

**To go within the depths of yourself, the parts of you that are yet unknown requires that you can see that it's there to be discovered. Ignorance will get you nowhere. How deep does the cave go? Once explored do you ever need to go back? The inner environment is dreamlike, it's shape changes over time especially as you change. When you've completed one journey you'll have uncovered more of the unknown unknowns.

*The hero whose attachment to ego is already annihilate passes back and forth across the horizons of the 5 9 Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, "Akimcanna: Self-Naughting" (New Indian Antiquary, Vol. Ill, Bombay, 1940), p. 6, note 14, citing and discussing Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, I, 63, 3.

And therein lies his power to save; for his passing and returning demonstrate that through all the con­ traries of phenomenality the Uncreate-Imperishable remains, and there is nothing to fear.*

**So that is the journey beyond the heroes journey. You become a hero and with your newfound powers you keep slaying dragons and maintain the peace of the realm and move it to prosperity.

*Inanna and Ereshkigal, the two sisters, light and dark respec­ tively, together represent, according to the antique manner of symbolization, the one goddess in two aspects; and their con­ frontation epitomizes the whole sense of the difficult road of trials. 
The hero, whether god or goddess, man or woman, the figure in a myth or the dreamer of a dream, discovers and assimilates his op­ posite (his own unsuspected self) either by swallowing it or by being swallowed. One by one the resistances are broken. He must put aside his pride, his virtue, beauty, and life, and bow or submit to the absolutely intolerable. Then he finds that he and his opposite are not of differing species, but one flesh*

**What does it mean to assimilate your opposite? Is it about accepting that though you may be kind you have evil in you as well. It's to know your own dark parts so they're not able to deceive you and set traps for you. What is the value of your dark parts? Is it knowledge of them that is important? Knowledge of them in one way means to embody them without really enacting them. You need to know them because they ended up there for a reason. They grew from the same soil as the good parts of you. How does your darkness operate? Where did it come from?

*The ordeal is a deepening of the problem of the first threshold and the question is still in balance: Can the ego put itself to death? 
For many-headed is this surrounding Hydra; one head cut off, two more appear—unless the right caustic is applied to the mutilated stump. The original departure into the land of trials represented only the beginning of the long and really perilous path of initiatory conquests and moments of illumination. Dragons have now to be slain and surprising barriers passed—again, again, and again. 
Meanwhile there will be a multitude of preliminary victories, unre-tainable ecstasies, and momentary glimpses of the wonderful land.*

**I suppose this is where Vervaeke would say that you need a counteracting dynamical system that can adapt to the self-deception that itself is very dynamical and will quickly figure out how to bypass your countermeasures unless they too are dynamic.

*ONCE having traversed the threshold, the hero moves in a dream landscape of curiously fluid, ambiguous forms, where he must survive a succession of trials. This is a favorite phase of the myth-adventure. It has produced a world literature of miraculous tests and ordeals. The hero is covertly aided by the advice, amulets, and secret agents of the supernatural helper whom he met before his entrance into this region. Or it may be that he here discovers for the first time that there is a benign power everywhere sup­ porting him in his superhuman passage.*

**The work of building up the character and the capacities of the hero requires facing actual challenges.

*The women may be unable to locate the shaman's position in the yonder world, in which case his spirit may fail to return to the body. Or the wandering spirit of an enemy shaman may engage him in battle or else lead him astray. It is said that there have been many shamans who failed to return*

**The lapps shamans sound very similar to the South American ones.

*There can be no question: the psychological dangers through which earlier generations were guided by the symbols and spiri­ tual exercises of their mythological and religious inheritance, we today (in so far as we are unbelievers, or, if believers, in so far as our inherited beliefs fail to represent the real problems of con­ temporary life) must face alone, or, at best, with only tentative, impromptu, and not often very effective guidance. This is our problem as modern, "enlightened" individuals, for whom all gods and devils have been rationalized out of existence.
24 Never­ theless, in the multitude of myths and legends that have been preserved to us, or collected from the ends of the earth, we may yet see delineated something of our still human course. To hear and profit, however, one may have to submit somehow to purga­ tion and surrender. And that is part of our problem: just how to do that. "Or do ye think that ye shall enter the Garden of Bliss without such trials as came to those who passed away be­ fore you?"
2 5*

**Words are inadequate to describe spiritual journeys, we need symbols. But it feels like all our symbols have died and no new ones have been born. We don't have the vocabulary necessary to get a grip on spiritual challenges. Spiritual in the sense of self transformation and overcoming self-deception, becoming more rational and wise. It's like we've outsourced that part to institutions but those institutions aren't doing their job. They've hollowed out spirituality because it's not easy to talk about from a business perspective.

*Woman, in the picture language of mythology, represents the totality of what can be known. The hero is the one who comes to know. As he progresses in the slow initiation which is life, the form of the goddess undergoes for him a series of transfigura­ tions: she can never be greater than himself, though she can al­ ways promise more than he is yet capable of comprehending. 
She lures, she guides, she bids him burst his fetters. And if he can match her import, the two, the knower and the known, will be released from every limitation. Woman is the guide to the sublime acme of sensuous adventure. By deficient eyes she is reduced to inferior states; by the evil eye of ignorance she is spellbound to banality and ugliness. But she is redeemed by the eyes of understanding. The hero who can take her as she is, without undue commotion but with the kindness and assurance she requires, is potentially the king, the incarnate god, of her created world.*

**Knowledge that you're not ready for is ugly.

*105 the galaxies of far-extending space, all swell within her womb. 
For she is the world creatrix, ever mother, ever virgin. She en­ compasses the encompassing, nourishes the nourishing, and is the life of everything that lives. 
She is also the death of everything that dies. The whole round of existence is accomplished within her sway, from birth, through adolescence, maturity, and senescence, to the grave. She is the womb and the tomb: the sow that eats her farrow. Thus she unites the "good" and the "bad," exhibiting the two modes of the remembered mother, not as personal only, but as univer­ sal. The devotee is expected to contemplate the two with equal equanimity. Through this exercise his spirit is purged of its in­ fantile, inappropriate sentimentalities and resentments, and his mind opened to the inscrutable presence which exists, not pri­ marily as "good" and "bad" with respect to his childlike human convenience, his weal and woe, but as the law and image of the nature of being.*

**How does this relate to the Tao? 

**Both creator and destroyer. The creative aspect is easy to see. How is the destructive aspect embodied?

**Equanimity through it all. I imagine someone who is able to ride the paradoxes without hesitation. Someone who is able to see the world for what it is and at the same understand different perspectives on what is.

*The mystical marriage with the queen goddess of the world repre­ sents the hero's total mastery of life; for the woman is life, the hero its knower and master. And the testings of the hero, which were preliminary to his ultimate experience and deed, were symbolical of those crises of realization by means of which his consciousness came to be amplified and made capable of enduring the full pos­ session of the mother-destroyer, his inevitable bride. With that he knows that he and the father are one: he is in the father's place.*

**What can go wrong leading up to this marriage? What can go wrong after?

*Generally we refuse to admit within ourselves, or within our friends, the fullness of that pushing, self-protective, malodorous, carnivorous, lecherous fever which is the very na­ ture of the organic cell. Rather, we tend to perfume, whitewash, and reinterpret; meanwhile imagining that all the flies in the ointment, all the hairs in the soup, are the faults of some un­ pleasant someone else. 
But when it suddenly dawns on us, or is forced to our atten­ tion, that everything we think or do is necessarily tainted with the odor of the flesh, then, not uncommonly, there is experienced a moment of revulsion: life, the acts of life, the organs of life, woman in particular as the great symbol of life, become intolera­ ble to the pure, the pure, pure soul.*

**To react with revulsion to what is, is that signifying that we need to go beyond our wild instincts? Self-denial doesn't feel wise, however setting up a system that let's you go transcend them feels worthy. 

---
Page: 206

*Where this Oedipus-Hamlet revulsion remains to beset the soul, there the world, the body, and woman above all, become the symbols no longer of victory but of defeat. A monastic-puritanical, world-negating ethical system then radically and im­ mediately transfigures all the images of myth. No longer can the hero rest in innocence with the goddess of the flesh; for she is become the queen of sin.*

**It kind of feels like you're throwing out the baby with the bath water when you're revolted in full by what the woman symbolizes.

---
Page: 213

*Atonement (at-one-ment) consists in no more than the abandonment of that self-generated double monster—the dragon thought to be God (superego) 4 7 and the dragon thought to be Sin (repressed id). But this requires an abandonment of the attachment to ego itself; and that is what is difficult. One must have a faith that the father is merciful, and then a reliance on that mercy. Therewith, the center of belief is transferred out­ side of the bedeviling god's tight scaly ring, and the dreadful ogres dissolve. 
It is in this ordeal that the hero may derive hope and assur­ ance from the helpful female figure, by whose magic (pollen charms or power of intercession) he is protected through all the frightening experiences of the father's ego-shattering initiation. 
For if it is impossible to trust the terrifying father-face, then one's faith must be centered elsewhere (Spider Woman, Blessed Mother); and with that reliance for support, one endures the crisis—only to find, in the end, that the father and mother reflect each other, and are in essence the same.*

**It's like every symbol changes meaning throughout the journey. They take on different roles and significance. And it's a nice description of opponent processing, though the opposites are part of the same substance, there's no duality underneath it.

Page: 218

*This tale of indulgent parenthood illustrates the antique idea that when the roles of life are assumed by the improperly initi­ ated, chaos supervenes. When the child outgrows the popular idyl of the mother breast and turns to face the world of special­ ized adult action, it passes, spiritually, into the sphere of the father—who becomes, for his son, the sign of the future task, and for his daughter, of the future husband. Whether he knows it or not, and no matter what his position in society, the father is the initiating priest through whom the young being passes on into the larger world. And just as, formerly, the mother repre­ sented the "good" and "evil," so now does he, but with this complication—that there is a new element of rivalry in the pic­ ture: the son against the father for the mastery of the universe, and the daughter against the mother to be the mastered world.*

**Growth and succession. The father is a symbol, though for some I guess their father symbol is their actual father. What about someone who grew up without one? 

---
Page: 228

*The paradox of creation, the coming of the forms of time out of eternity, is the germinal secret of the father. It can never be quite explained. Therefore, in every system of theology there is an umbilical point, an Achilles tendon which the finger of mother life has touched, and where the possibility of perfect knowledge has been impaired. The problem of the hero is to pierce himself (and therewith his world) precisely through that point; to shat­ ter and annihilate that key knot of his limited existence.*

**Is it that we seek an explanation of the ineffable? We want a way to draw a distinct boundary. It's the ground of being, existence and the bridge between them.

*Mahayana Buddhism has developed a pantheon of many Bodhisattvas and many past and future Buddhas. These all inflect the manifested powers of the transcendent, one and only Adi-Buddha ("Primal Buddha") (compare note 51, p. 81, supra), who is the highest conceivable source and ultimate boundary of all being, suspended in the void of nonbeing like a wonderful bubble.*

**I wonder if the bubble in The Fountain is related to this.

*Like the Buddha himself, this godlike being is a pattern of the divine state to which the human hero attains who has gone be­ yond the last terrors of ignorance. "When the envelopment of consciousness has been annihilated, then he becomes free of all fear, beyond the reach of change."
8 4 This is the release potential within us all, and which anyone can attain—through herohood; 
for, as we read: "All things are Buddha-things";
8 5 or again (and this is the other way of making the same statement) : "All beings are without self."*

**Is the journey done here? What do you do when you're fully free? I suppose part of it is that there's nothing that can tell you what should be done. To remain intact in such a state requires an infinitely strong body. In a sense the point is that you don't remain intact, you are no longer you, you are cosmos.

*for when, during his final life on earth as a human being, he shattered for himself the bounds of the last threshold (which moment opened to him the timelessness of the void beyond the frustrating mirage-enigmas of the named and bounded cosmos), he paused: he made a vow that before enter­ ing the void he would bring all creatures without exception to enlightenment; and since then he has permeated the whole tex­ ture of existence with the divine grace of his assisting presence,*

**If you'd be able to be in a state of consciousness felt during psychedelics permanently, it'd sure feel like timelessness. How do you deal with that feeling for too long. Every second gets cleaved infinitely many times. It'd be like you're experiencing everything and nothing at the same time.

*"When the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the first man, He created him androgynous."
9 1 The removal of the feminine into another form symbolizes the beginning of the fall from perfec­ tion into duality; and it was naturally followed by the discovery of the duality of good and evil, exile from the garden where God walks on earth, and thereupon the building of the wall of Paradise, constituted of the "coincidence of opposites," 92 by which Man (now man and woman) is cut off from not only the vision but even the recollection of the image of God. 
This is the Biblical version of a myth known to many lands. It represents one of the basic ways of symbolizing the mystery of creation: the devolvement of eternity into time, the breaking of the one into the two and then the many, as well as the generation of new life through the reconjunction of the two.*

**I didn't know this is how Adam and Eve symbolized the creation of things. It's a devolvement from the perfect unity. It's what we aim to get back to, we're trying to recreate paradise where opposites are clearly the same and time is no longer. Out of paradise the world was born. Kind of through our consciousness ways of distinguishing things.

*Totem, tribal, racial, and aggressively missionizing cults rep­ resent only partial solutions of the psychological problem of subduing hate by love; they only partially initiate. Ego is not an­ nihilated in them; rather, it is enlarged; instead of thinking only of himself, the individual becomes dedicated to the whole of his society. The rest of the world meanwhile (that is to say, by far the greater portion of mankind) is left outside the sphere of his sympathy and protection because outside the sphere of the pro­ tection of his god. And there takes place, then, that dramatic di­ vorce of the two principles of love and hate which the pages of history so bountifully illustrate. Instead of clearing his own heart the zealot tries to clear the world. The laws of the City of God are applied only to his in-group (tribe, church, nation, class, or what not) while the fire of a perpetual holy war is hurled (with good conscience, and indeed a sense of pious service) against whatever uncircumcised, barbarian, heathen, "native," or alien people happens to occupy the position of neighbor*

**Misinterpreting the symbols and the voice of the cosmos can lead to increasing scales of bloodshed. Ego expansion rather than ego transcendence is very dangerous. How does it start to get misinterpreted? I guess it's when the mythical traditions devolve or someone actively misconstrues it for their benefit.

*If ye realize the Emptiness of All Things, Compassion will arise within your hearts; 
If ye lose all differentiation between yourselves and others, fit to serve others ye will be; 
And when in serving others ye shall win success, then shall ye meet with me; 
And finding me, ye shall attain to Buddhahood*

**Why is it compassion that arises from emptiness? Is it the ego caring for itself, just that it now encompasses everything?

*We and that protecting father are one. This is the redeeming insight. That protecting father is every man we meet. And so it must be known that, though this ignorant, limited, self-defending, suffering body may regard it­ self as threatened by some other—the enemy—that one too is the God. The ogre breaks us, but the hero, the fit candidate, un­ dergoes the initiation "like a man"; and behold, it was the fa­ ther: we in Him and He in us.
1 1 6 The dear, protecting mother of our body could not defend us from the Great Father Serpent; 
the mortal, tangible body that she gave us was delivered into his frightening power. But death was not the end. New life, new birth, new knowledge of existence (so that we live not in this physique only, but in all bodies, all physiques of the world, as the Bodhisattva) was given us. That father was himself the womb, the mother, of a second birth.

**The further away you are from the seed the more differentiated you are but you're still part of the same tree as everything that is, was and will be. It's when you start identifying with the tree and even ground it grows from that you realize that you've always existed and always will.

*As the reader will recall: in the legend of the Temptation under the Bo Tree (supra, pp. 31-32) the antagonist of the Future Buddha was Kama-Mara, literally "Desire—Hostility," or "Love and Death," the magician of Delusion. He was a personification of the Threefold Fire and of the difficulties of the last test, a final threshold guardian to be passed by the universal hero on his supreme adventure to Nirvana. Having subdued within himself to the critical point of the ultimate ember the Threefold Fire, which is the moving power of the universe, the Savior beheld reflected, as in a mirror all around him, the last projected fan­ tasies of his primitive physical will to live like other human be­ ings—the will to live according to the normal motives of desire and hostility, in a delusory ambient of phenomenal causes, ends, and means. He was assailed by the last fury of the disregarded flesh. And this was the moment on which all depended; for from one coal could arise again the whole conflagration.*

**Putting it in practical terms, it's to get your motivations from first principles, to have them be pure. Not anchored in fear of death or thirst for life. What does the world feel like when you've removed the need to fear death?

*Therefore the aim of the religious teaching is not to cure the individual back again to the general delusion, but to detach him from delusion altogether; and this not by readjusting the desire (eros) and hostility (thanatos)-for that would only originate a new context of delusion-but by ex­ tinguishing the impulses to the very root, according to the method of the celebrated Buddhist Eightfold Path: 
Right Belief, Right Intentions, Right Speech, Right Actions, Right Livelihood, Right Endeavoring, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.*

**The Eightfold Path, how literally should one interpret it? Is it very concrete and practical? To get all the Rights you need to have an extensive set of practices.

1 2 9 During the long and peaceful Tokugawa pe­ riod (1603-1868), before the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1854, the texture of Japanese life became so imbued with significant formalization that existence to the slightest detail was a conscious expression of eternity, the landscape itself a shrine. 
Similarly, throughout the Orient, throughout the ancient world, and in the pre-Columbian Americas, society and nature represented to the mind the inexpressible. "The plants, rocks, fire, water, all are alive. They watch us and see our needs. They see when we have nothing to protect us," declared an old Apache storyteller, "and it is then that they reveal themselves and speak to us."

*The third wonder of the Bodhisattva myth is that the first wonder (namely, the bisexual form) is symbolical of the second (the identity of eternity and time). For in the language of the di­ vine pictures, the world of time is the great mother womb. The life therein, begotten by the father, is compounded of her dark­ ness and his light.

*The ease with which the adventure is here accomplished signifies that the hero is a superior man, a born king. Such ease two chariot wheels, thus he looks down upon day and night, thus upon good deeds and evil deeds, and upon all the pairs of opposites. This one, devoid of good deeds, devoid of evil deeds, a knower of God, unto very God he goes." 1 3 6 Curtin, op. cit., pp. 106-107. 
159 I N I T I A T I O N distinguishes numerous fairy tales and all legends of the deeds of incarnate gods. Where the usual hero would face a test, the elect encounters no delaying obstacle and makes no mistake. The well is the World Navel, its flaming water the indestructible essence of existence, the bed going round and round being the World Axis. The sleeping castle is that ultimate abyss to which the de­ scending consciousness submerges in dream, where the individ­ ual life is on the point of dissolving into undifferentiated energy: 
and it would be death to dissolve; yet death, also, to lack the fire. 
The motif (derived from an infantile fantasy) of the inexhaustible dish, symbolizing the perpetual life-giving, form-building pow­ ers of the universal source, is a fairy-tale counterpart of the mytho­ logical image of the cornucopian banquet of the gods. While the bringing together of the two great symbols of the meeting with the goddess and the fire theft reveals with simplicity and clarity the status of the anthropomorphic powers in the realm of myth. 
They are not ends in themselves, but guardians, embodiments, or bestowers, of the liquor, the milk, the food, the fire, the grace, of indestructible life.*

**In this part of the journey is the hero already trained and ready and that's why it's easy for him? It's a bit weird with a hero's quest without adversity.

*The gods and goddesses then are to be understood as embodi­ ments and custodians of the elixir of Imperishable Being but not themselves the Ultimate in its primary state. What the hero seeks through his intercourse with them is therefore not finally them­ selves, but their grace, i.e., the power of their sustaining sub­ stance. This miraculous energy-substance and this alone is the Imperishable; the names and forms of the deities who everywhere embody, dispense, and represent it come and go. This is the miraculous energy of the thunderbolts of Zeus, Yahweh, and the Supreme Buddha, the fertility of the rain of Viracocha, the virtue announced by the bell rung in the Mass at the consecration, 157 and the light of the ultimate illumination of the saint and sage. 
Its guardians dare release it only to the duly proven. 
But the gods may be over severe, overcautious, in which case the hero must trick them of their treasure. Such was the problem of Prometheus. When in this mood even the highest gods appear as malignant, life-hoarding ogres, and the hero who deceives, slays, or appeases them is honored as the savior of the world.*

**What's the significance of their grace? And why is it that they're sometimes oversevere? Is this signifying a succession of whatever the God embodied? Is this how we upgrade our symbols? Or are the obstacles necessary as they not only embody what they're protecting they're signifying the difficulty to obtain what they're embodying?

*Humor is the touchstone of the truly mythological as distinct from the more literal-minded and sentimental theological mood. 
The gods as icons are not ends in themselves. Their entertaining myths transport the mind and spirit, not up to, but past them, into the yonder void; from which perspective the more heavily freighted theological dogmas then appear to have been only ped­ agogical lures: their function, to cart the unadroit intellect away from its concrete clutter of facts and events to a comparatively rarefied zone, where, as a final boon, all existence—whether heavenly, earthly, or infernal—may at last be seen transmuted into the semblance of a lightly passing, recurrent, mere child­ hood dream of bliss and fright.*

**Humor is a way of liberating yourself, of playing outside the realm of the real.

*The research for physical immortality proceeds from a misun­ derstanding of the traditional teaching. On the contrary, the basic problem is: to enlarge the pupil of the eye, so that the body with its attendant personality will no longer obstruct the view. Im­ mortality is then experienced as a present fact: "It is here! It is here!"
1 6 5 "All things are in process, rising and returning. Plants come to blossom, but only to return to the root. Returning to the root is like seeking tranquility. Seeking tranquility is like moving to­ ward destiny. To move toward destiny is like eternity. To know eternity is enlightenment, and not to recognize eternity brings disorder and evil. 
"Knowing eternity makes one comprehensive; comprehension makes one broadminded; breadth of vision brings nobility; no­ bility is like heaven. 
"The heavenly is like Tao. Tao is the Eternal. The decay of the body is not to be feared."
1 6 6 The Japanese have a proverb: "The gods only laugh when men pray to them for wealth." The boon bestowed on the wor­ shiper is always scaled to his stature and to the nature of his dom­ inant desire: the boon is simply a symbol of life energy stepped down to the requirements of a certain specific case. The irony, of course, lies in the fact that, whereas the hero who has won the favor of the god may beg for the boon of perfect illumination, what he generally seeks are longer years to live, weapons with which to slay his neighbor, or the health of his child.*

**Enlightenment, perfect illumination, that's the path to real immortality, not immortality of the flesh. That's the highest boon that our myths tell us about.

*The agony of breaking through personal limitations is the agony of spiritual growth. Art, literature, myth and cult, philos­ ophy, and ascetic disciplines are instruments to help the individ­ ual past his limiting horizons into spheres of ever-expanding realization. As he crosses threshold after threshold, conquering dragon after dragon, the stature of the divinity that he summons to his highest wish increases, until it subsumes the cosmos. Fi­ nally, the mind breaks the bounding sphere of the cosmos to a realization transcending all experiences of form—all symboliza-tions, all divinities: a realization of the ineluctable void.*

**I'm happy to see that it's recognized that it's an iterative process. Keep slaying and expanding, until you've expanded to encompass infinity.

*This is the highest and ultimate crucifixion, not only of the hero, but of his god as well. Here the Son and the Father alike are annihilated—as personality-masks over the unnamed. For just as the figments of a dream derive from the life energy of one dreamer, representing only fluid splittings and complications of that single force, so do all the forms of all the worlds, whether terrestrial or divine, reflect the universal force of a single in­ scrutable mystery: the power that constructs the atom and con­ trols the orbits of the stars. 
That font of life is the core of the individual, and within him­ self he will find it—if he can tear the coverings away.*

**We're all made of cosmos. Differentiated atoms and particles is just a convenient course graining of the material that is existence and void.

*"Flags and banners erected on the eastern rim of the world let their streamers fly to the western rim of the world; likewise 169 Poetic Edda, "Hovamol," 139 (translation by Henry Adams Bellows; The American-Scandinavian Foundation; New York, 1923). 
177 I N I T I A T I O N those erected on the western rim of the world, to the eastern rim of the world; those erected on the northern rim of the world, to the southern rim of the world; and those erected on the southern rim of the world, to the northern rim of the world; while those erected on the level of the earth let theirs fly until they beat against the Brahma-world; and those of the Brahma-world let theirs hang down to the level of the earth. Throughout the ten thousand worlds the flowering trees bloomed; the fruit trees were weighted down by the burden of their fruit; trunk-lotuses bloomed on the trunks of trees; branch-lotuses on the branches of trees; vine-lotuses on the vines; hanging-lotuses in the sky; 
and stalk-lotuses burst through the rocks and came up by sev­ ens. The system of ten thousand worlds was like a bouquet of flowers sent whirling through the air, or like a thick carpet of flowers; in the intermundane spaces the eight-thousand-league-long hells, which not even the light of seven suns had formerly been able to illumine, were now flooded with radiance; the eighty-four-thousand-league-deep ocean became sweet to the taste; the rivers checked their flowing; the blind from birth re­ ceived their sight; the deaf from birth their hearing; the crippled from birth the use of their limbs; and the bonds and fetters of captives broke and fell off."*

**Feels like a poetic account of the ineffable. Reality is massively rich that when we can really see it we can't bring it down to just words. It's infinitely fractal, you can go deeper and deeper forever. It's like going deeper is part of generating the further depths themselves. In a way it feels like trickery, like how game developers design levels to feel infinite. Perhaps the universe itself is using similar principles to feel infinite whereas it's not?

*W H E N the hero-quest has been accomplished, through penetra­ tion to the source, or through the grace of some male or female, human or animal, personification, the adventurer still must re­ turn with his life-transmuting trophy. The full round, the norm of the monomyth, requires that the hero shall now begin the labor of bringing the runes of wisdom, the Golden Fleece, or his sleeping princess, back into the kingdom of humanity, where the boon may redound to the renewing of the community, the na­ tion, the planet, or the ten thousand worlds. 
But the responsibility has been frequently refused. Even the Buddha, after his triumph, doubted whether the message of re­ alization could be communicated, and saints are reported to have passed away while in the supernal ecstasy. Numerous indeed are the heroes fabled to have taken up residence forever in the blessed isle of the unaging Goddess of Immortal Being.*

**In a way it's a warning against the hippie trope of disconnecting yourself from society and your family. In a way it's the death by ecstasy and chasing the dragon.

*If the hero in his triumph wins the blessing of the goddess or the god and is then explicitly commissioned to return to the world with some elixir for the restoration of society, the final stage of his adventure is supported by all the powers of his supernatural patron. On the other hand, if the trophy has been attained against the opposition of its guardian, or if the hero's wish to re­ turn to the world has been resented by the gods or demons, then the last stage of the mythological round becames a lively, often comical, pursuit. This flight may be complicated by marvels of magical obstruction and evasion.*

**How many forms has this elixir of restoration taken throughout time and throughout art? What is to say that society won't reject it?

*Having moved a step beyond the creative sphere of all-father Izanagi into the field of dissolution, Izanami had sought to pro­ tect her brother-husband. When he had seen more than he could bear, he lost his innocence of death but, with his august will to live, drew up as a mighty rock that protecting veil which we all have held, ever since, between our eyes and the grave. 
The Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, and hundreds of analogous tales throughout the world, suggest, as does this ancient legend of the farthest East, that in spite of the failure recorded, a possibility exists of a return of the lover with his lost love from beyond the terrible threshold. It is always some little fault, some slight yet critical symptom of human frailty, that makes impossi­ ble the open interrelationship between the worlds; so that one is tempted to believe, almost, that if the small, marring accident could be avoided, all would be well.*

**Immortality and the like will always be slightly out of reach. We are instantiated beings, and the will to live is a reflection of the fear of death. And the inevitability of death is just so unfortunate.

*The powers of the abyss are not to be challenged lightly. In the Orient, a great point is made of the danger of undertaking the psychologically disturbing practices of yoga without compe­ tent supervision. The meditations of the postulant have to be ad­ justed to his progress, so that the imagination may be defended at every step by devatas (envisioned, adequate deities) until the moment comes for the prepared spirit to step alone beyond. As Dr. Jung has very wisely observed: "The incomparably useful function of the dogmatic symbol [is that] it protects a person from a direct experience of God as long as he does not mischie­ vously expose himself. But if... he leaves home and family, lives too long alone, and gazes too deeply into the dark mirror, then the awful event of the meeting may befall him.*

**Vervaeke mentions this as well, that we should weary of auto didactic methods of enlightenment. I don't quite understand why. Though I can see value in staying grounded and not float away too far. You lose perspective and you're more likely to be deceived by yourself. You also don't contribute anything back to the world and to the universe. You squander the opportunity you had by being born in the first place.

*The hero may have to be brought back from his supernatural ad­ venture by assistance from without. That is to say, the world may have to come and get him. For the bliss of the deep abode is not lightly abandoned in favor of the self-scattering of the wak­ ened state. "Who having cast off the world," we read, "would desire to return again? He would be only there" 10 And yet, in so far as one is alive, life will call. Society is jealous of those who re­ main away from it, and will come knocking at the door. If the hero—like Muchukunda—is unwilling, the disturber suffers an ugly shock; but on the other hand, if the summoned one is only delayed—sealed in by the beatitude of the state of perfect being (which resembles death)—an apparent rescue is effected, and the adventurer returns.*

**What is the hero's role here? To accept the help? Do they have any agency at all here? Is that the point, that they're in need?

*His consciousness having succumbed, the unconscious neverthe­ less supplies its own balances, and he is born back into the world from which he came. Instead of holding to and saving his ego, as in the pattern of the magic flight, he loses it, and yet, through grace, it is returned. 
This brings us to the final crisis of the round, to which the whole miraculous excursion has been but a prelude—that, namely, of the paradoxical, supremely difficult threshold-crossing of the hero's return from the mystic realm into the land of common day. Whether rescued from without, driven from within, or gen­ tly carried along by the guiding divinities, he has yet to re-enter with his boon the long-forgotten atmosphere where men who are fractions imagine themselves to be complete. He has yet to confront society with his ego-shattering, life-redeeming elixir, and take the return blow of reasonable queries, hard resentment, and good people at a loss to comprehend.*

**The ego lost and returned has a different role in your life going forward. 

**What is the return threshold? Is it to once again become mortal? To once again become sinful? Reminds me of Hercules who was a god, then mortal, then god and then finally mortal again. His goal changed throughout his life, and his final goal was to live out life together with Megara. It's not so much that his goal changed, it's that he found what was truly meaningful to him and then he chose path accordingly. The other goals he had were superficial and based on fantasies.

*The two worlds, the divine and the human, can be pictured only as distinct from each other—different as life and death, as day and night. The hero adventures out of the land we know into darkness; there he accomplishes his adventure, or again is simply lost to us, imprisoned, or in danger; and his return is described as a coming back out of that yonder zone. Nevertheless—and here is a great key to the understanding of myth and symbol— the two kingdoms are actually one. The realm of the gods is a forgotten dimension of the world we know. And the exploration of that dimension, either willingly or unwillingly, is the whole 201 from without. They show in the final stages of the adventure the continued operation of the supernatural assisting force that has been attending the elect through the whole course of his ordeal.

R E T U R N sense of the deed of the hero. The values and distinctions that in normal life seem important disappear with the terrifying assimi­ lation of the self into what formerly was only otherness. As in the stories of the cannibal ogresses, the fearfulness of this loss of personal individuation can be the whole burden of the transcen­ dental experience for unqualified souls. But the hero-soul goes boldly in—and discovers the hags converted into goddesses and the dragons into the watchdogs of the gods.*

**Symbols help us understand how we understand. They bring forth the unspeakable processing of our unconscious mind. Our conscious mind and our unconscious mind are clearly one and the same. As we shine light on the corners of our mind that rule us without our awareness let's us better avoid self-deception, gain insight and transcend our current framing. It helps us realize what's actually relevant and what's bullshit.

*The boon brought from the transcendent deep be­ comes quickly rationalized into nonentity, and the need becomes great for another hero to refresh the word. 
How teach again, however, what has been taught correctly and incorrectly learned a thousand thousand times, throughout the millenniums of mankind's prudent folly? That is the hero's ulti­ mate difficult task. How render back into light-world language the speech-defying pronouncements of the dark? How represent on a two-dimensional surface a three-dimensional form, or in a three-dimensional image a multi-dimensional meaning? How translate into terms of "yes" and "no" revelations that shatter into meaninglessness every attempt to define the pairs of oppo-sites? How communicate to people who insist on the exclusive evidence of their senses the message of the all-generating void?*

**I suppose there wouldn't be a story if the hero himself didn't try to explain it. Without the story we wouldn't grow wiser together. But yes, the challenge certainly is how to explain the unexplainable. 

**Each successive lesson brought home by the hero is over time scrutinized to a spot where it no longer feels viable to us, it doesn't include X or includes Y when it shouldn't or it has simply been mutated by the changing context its embedded in. Each successive hero is able to give a new perspective on the unexplainable and make it viable for us once again. And so the cycle goes.

*Why re-enter such a world? Why attempt to make plausi­ ble, or even interesting, to men and women consumed with pas­ sion, the experience of transcendental bliss? As dreams that were momentous by night may seem simply silly in the light of day, so the poet and the prophet can discover themselves playing the idiot before a jury of sober eyes. The easy thing is to commit the whole community to the devil and retire again into the heav­ enly rock-dwelling, close the door, and make it fast. But if some spiritual obstetrician has meanwhile drawn the shimenawa across the retreat, then the work of representing eternity in time, and perceiving in time eternity, cannot be avoided.*

**There are other important actors besides the hero. There may be wise men around that have to drag the hero out of his cave, to shine the light onto the world. Maybe the hero will play that role once he's of old age? Still, why should you care about the peasants who didn't even try to venture out there in the first place? Well, they are you. You are them. You don't care about them, you care about yourself which just so happens to be the same thing. You care about parts of your body living in harmony, for whatever reason the world feels pain and that can be alleviated by cosmos living a good life.

*Oisin had done better than poor Rip; he had kept his eyes open in the adventurous realm. He had descended consciously (awake) into the kingdom of the unconscious (deep sleep) and had incor­ porated the values of the subliminal experience into his waking personality. A transmutation had been effected. But precisely because of this highly desirable circumstance, the dangers of his return were the greater. Since his entire personality had been 2 0 Washington Irving, The Sketch Book, "Rip van Winkle." 205 R E T U R N brought into accord with the powers and forms of timelessness, all of him stood to be refuted, blasted, by the impact of the forms and powers of time.*

*The equating of a single year in Paradise to one hundred of earthly existence is a motif well known to myth. The full round of one hundred signifies totality. Similarly, the three hundred and sixty degrees of the circle signify totality; accordingly the Hindu Puranas represent one year of the gods as equal to three hundred and sixty of men. From the standpoint of the Olympians, eon after eon of earthly history rolls by, revealing ever the har­ monious form of the total round, so that where men see only change and death, the blessed behold immutable form, world without end.*

*Many folksongs give testi­ mony to the dangers of the broken ring. And the myths—for ex­ ample, the myths assembled by Ovid in his great compendium, the Metamorphoses—recount again and again the shocking trans­ formations that take place when the insulation between a highly concentrated power center and the lower power field of the sur­ rounding world is, without proper precautions, suddenly taken away. According to the fairy lore of the Celts and Germans, a gnome or elf caught abroad by the sunrise is turned immediately into a stick or a stone. 
The returning hero, to complete his adventure, must survive the impact of the world.*

**Successfully communicating what's beyond is very difficult. Most of the time you sound like a blabbering buffoon and as you see the world rejecting you, so do you start doubting what you saw with your own eyes and it fizzles out. How do you preserve what you learned?

*The encounter and separation, for all its wildness, is typical of the sufferings of love. For when a heart insists on its destiny, re­ sisting the general blandishment, then the agony is great; so too the danger. Forces, however, will have been set in motion be­ yond the reckoning of the senses. Sequences of events from the corners of the world will draw gradually together, and miracles of coincidence bring the inevitable to pass. The talismanic ring from the soul's encounter with its other portion in the place of recollectedness betokens that the heart was there aware of what Rip van Winkle missed; it betokens too a conviction of the wak­ ing mind that the reality of the deep is not belied by that of com­ mon day. This is the sign of the hero's requirement, now, to knit together his two worlds. 
The remainder of the long story of Kamar al-Zaman is a history of the slow yet wonderful operation of a destiny that has been summoned into life. Not everyone has a destiny: only the hero who has plunged to touch it, and has come up again—with a ring.*

*We may doubt whether such a scene ever actually took place. But that would not help us any; for we are concerned, at present, with problems of symbolism, not of historicity. We do not particularly care whether Rip van Winkle, Kamar al-Zaman, or Jesus Christ ever actually lived. Their stories are what con­ cern us: and these stories are so widely distributed over the world—attached to various heroes in various lands—that the question of whether this or that local carrier of the universal theme may or may not have been a historical, living man can be of only secondary moment. The stressing of this historical ele­ ment will lead to confusion; it will simply obfuscate the picture message.*

**See what the story can teach you. However, a certain kind of skepticism has to be allowed I suppose. And when going for a monomythic interpretation I think you risk over pattern matching and confirmation bias.

*Having heard these words of Krishna, Arjuna trembled, folded his hands in adoration, and bowed down. Overwhelmed with fear, he saluted Krishna and then addressed Him again, with fal­ tering voice. 
" . . . Thou art the first of gods, the ancient Soul; Thou art the supreme Resting-place of the universe; Thou art the Knower and That which is to be known and the Ultimate Goal. And by Thee is the world pervaded, O Thou of infinite form. Thou art Wind and Death and Fire and Moon and the Lord of Water. 
Thou art the First Man and the Great-grandsire. Salutations, salutations to Thee! . . . I rejoice that I have seen what was never seen before; but my mind is also troubled with fear. Show me that other form of Thine. Be gracious, O Lord of Gods, O Abode of the Universe. I would see Thee as before, with Thy crown and Thy mace and the discus in Thy hand. Assume again Thy four-armed shape, O Thou of a thousand arms and of end­ less shapes."*

**Reminds me of the fountain when the guardian of the fountain recognizes in Tommy the first father. 

**If life is represented by the battlefield they stood, what does it symbolize to stop the war?

*Om. The head of the sacrificial horse is the dawn, its eye the sun, its vital force the air, its open mouth the fire called Vaishvanara, and the body of the sacrificial horse is the year. Its back is heaven, its belly the sky, its hoof the earth, its sides the four quarters, its ribs the intermediate quarters, its mem­ bers the seasons, its joints the months and fortnights, its feet the days and nights, its bones the stars and its flesh the clouds. Its half-digested food is the sand, its blood-vessels the rivers, its liver and spleen the mountains, its hairs the herbs and trees. Its forepart is the ascending sun, its hind part the descend­ ing sun, its yawning is lightning, its shaking the body is thundering, its urinat­ ing is raining, and its neighing is voice.*

**It almost sounds like primal language. Understanding the world around you through what you know most intimate. And building from there. It's the same thing with old myths, they feel basic but that's because they had simpler building blocks to begin with. We're standing on the shoulders of giants, we're making use of what they built which makes it easier to build more complex stories.

*Symbols are only the vehicles of communication; they must not be mistaken for the final term, the tenor, of their reference. 
No matter how attractive or impressive they may seem, they re­ main but convenient means, accommodated to the understand­ ing. Hence the personality or personalities of God—whether represented in trinitarian, dualistic, or unitarian terms, in poly­ theistic, monotheistic, or henotheistic terms, pictorially or ver­ bally, as documented fact or as apocalyptic vision—no one should attempt to read or interpret as the final thing. The problem of the theologian is to keep his symbol translucent, so that it may not block out the very light it is supposed to convey. "For then alone do we know God truly," writes Saint Thomas Aquinas, "when we believe that He is far above all that man can possibly think of God."
3 3 And in the Kena Upanishad, in the same spirit: 
"To know is not to know; not to know is to know."
3 4 Mistaking a vehicle for its tenor may lead to the spilling not only of value­ less ink, but of valuable blood.*

**The fact that symbols have to be interpreted is what makes them so slippery. Who has the correct interpretation? Perhaps the point is that, saying that there's a correct interpretation is wrong in the first place. Good symbols do their work at a deeper level than propositions.

*"Whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it."
3 6 The meaning is very clear; it is the meaning of all religious practice. The individual, through prolonged psychological dis­ ciplines, gives up completely all attachment to his personal limi­ tations, idiosyncrasies, hopes and fears, no longer resists the self-annihilation that is prerequisite to rebirth in the realization of truth, and so becomes ripe, at last, for the great at-one-ment. 
His personal ambitions being totally dissolved, he no longer tries to live but willingly relaxes to whatever may come to pass in him; he becomes, that is to say, an anonymity. The Law lives in him with his unreserved consent.*

**It's not about becoming subservient to someone. It's about accepting the world for what it is. You're like water. You're like an open-ended search. You're perfectly situationally aware and adaptable. It's also about letting go of your old self.

*What, now, is the result of the miraculous passage and return? 
The battlefield is symbolic of the field of life, where every creature lives on the death of another. A realization of the in­ evitable guilt of life may so sicken the heart that, like Hamlet or like Arjuna, one may refuse to go on with it. On the other hand, like most of the rest of us, one may invent a false, finally un­ justified, image of oneself as an exceptional phenomenon in the world, not guilty as others are, but justified in one's inevitable sinning because one represents the good. Such self-righteousness leads to a misunderstanding, not only of oneself but of the na­ ture of both man and the cosmos. The goal of the myth is to dis­ pel the need for such life ignorance by effecting a reconciliation of the individual consciousness with the universal will. And this is effected through a realization of the true relationship of the passing phenomena of time to the imperishable life that lives and dies in all.*

**A reconciliation of life and death. Could there be a more critical synthesis? 

**The circle of life, death feeds life and from life comes death. You are not to delude yourself into thinking you're above it, and you're not to be disheartened by it. What's to keep you participating in it? Life is beyond your form. You're simply the machine for a ghost that is as old as life and will be there until the end of all life.

*"Even as a person casts off worn-out clothes and puts on oth­ ers that are new, so the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters into others that are new. Weapons cut It not; fire burns It not; water wets It not; the wind does not wither It. 
This Self cannot be cut nor burnt nor wetted nor withered. Eter­ nal, all-pervading, unchanging, immovable, the Self is the same for ever."*

**Much like the idea that a particular program embodies is simply one of any number of instantiations of it. Each instantiation is unique, important and necessary for the idea to walk the earth.

*Man in the world of action loses his centering in the principle of eternity if he is anxious for the outcome of his deeds, but rest­ ing them and their fruits on the knees of the Living God he is released by them, as by a sacrifice, from the bondages of the sea of death. "Do without attachment the work you have to do. . . . 
Surrendering all action to Me, with mind intent on the Self, 38 Bhagavad Gita, 2:22-24. 
221 R E T U R N freeing yourself from longing and selfishness, fight—unperturbed by grief."
39 Powerful in this insight, calm and free in action, elated that through his hand should flow the grace of Viracocha, the hero is the conscious vehicle of the terrible, wonderful Law, whether his work be that of butcher, jockey, or king.*

**Kind of sounds like the flow state. Most certainly what they mean is something more profound. Are they referring to a kind of hakuna matata way of life? Are they referring to a relaxing of your own judgements of what is? To know what you don't know?

*Gwion Bach, who, having tasted three drops from the poison kettle of inspiration, was eaten by the hag Caridwen, reborn as an infant, and committed to the sea, was found next morning in a fishtrap by a hapless and sorely disappointed young man named Elphin, son of the wealthy landholder Gwyddno, whose horses had been killed by the flood of the burst kettle's poison.*

**It would be fun to try and think of yourself as the reincarnation of some deity. Perhaps it'd make it easier to internalize the sage?

*The mythological hero, setting forth from his common-day hut or castle, is lured, carried away, or else voluntarily proceeds, to the threshold of adventure. There he encounters a shadow presence that guards the passage. The hero may defeat or conciliate this power and go alive into the kingdom of the dark (brother-battle, dragon-battle; offering, charm), or be slain by the opponent and descend in death (dismemberment, crucifixion). Beyond the threshold, then, the hero journeys through a world of unfamiliar yet strangely inti­ mate forces, some of which severely threaten him (tests), some of which give magical aid (helpers). When he arrives at the nadir of the mythological round, he undergoes a supreme ordeal and gains his reward. The triumph may be represented as the hero's sexual 227 T H E KEYS union with the goddess-mother of the world (sacred marriage), his recognition by the father-creator (father atonement), his own di-vinization (apotheosis), or again—if the powers have remained unfriendly to him—his theft of the boon he came to gain (bride-theft, fire-theft); intrinsically it is an expansion of consciousness and therewith of being (illumination, transfiguration, freedom). The final work is that of the return. If the powers have blessed the hero, he now sets forth under their protection (emissary); if not, he flees and is pursued (transformation flight, obstacle flight). At the re­ turn threshold the transcendental powers must remain behind; the hero re-emerges from the kingdom of dread (return, resurrection). 
The boon that he brings restores the world (elixir).*

**It's such a general formula that you see it in many of our stories. Even if you follow this template you may get a story that's bad. What are the additional ingredients to make a good story?

**Hercules does all three, the sacred marriage, atonement and divinization. Although he let's go of the third in favor of the first.

*The changes rung on the simple scale of the monomyth defy description. Many tales isolate and greatly enlarge upon one or two of the typical elements of the full cycle (test motif, flight motif, abduction of the bride), others string a number of inde­ pendent cycles into a single series (as in the Odyssey). Differing characters or episodes can become fused, or a single element can reduplicate itself and reappear under many changes. 
The outlines of myths and tales are subject to damage and ob­ scuration. Archaic traits are generally eliminated or subdued. 
Imported materials are revised to fit local landscape, custom, or belief, and always suffer in the process. Furthermore, in the in­ numerable retellings of a traditional story, accidental or inten­ tional dislocations are inevitable. To account for elements that have become, for one reason or another, meaningless, secondary interpretations are invented, often with considerable skill.*

**There are a lot of orthogonal knobs one can turn which makes the number of variations combinatorially explosive. It has all the necessary components for evolution to do work on it.

*But in our Eskimo story this fire-making image underwent a modification. The female principle was personified in the beauti­ ful girl whom Raven encountered in the great room within the animal; meanwhile the conjunction of male and female was sym­ bolized separately in the flow of the oil from the pipe into the burning lamp. Raven's tasting of this oil was his participation in the act. The resultant cataclysm represented the typical crisis of 229 T H E KEYS the nadir, the termination of the old eon and initiation of the new. Raven's emergence then symbolized the miracle of rebirth. 
Thus, the original fire sticks having become superfluous, a clever and amusing epilogue was invented to give them a function in the plot. Having left the fire sticks in the belly of the whale, Raven was able to interpret their rediscovery as an ill-luck omen, frighten the people away, and enjoy the blubber feast alone. 
This epilogue is an excellent example of secondary elaboration. 
It plays on the trickster character of the hero but is not an ele­ ment of the basic story.*

**It's really cool to see the evolutionary nature of stories play out.

*Wherever the poetry of myth is interpreted as biography, his­ tory, or science, it is killed. The living images become only remote 230 T H E KEYS facts of a distant time or sky. Furthermore, it is never difficult to demonstrate that as science and history mythology is absurd. 
When a civilization begins to reinterpret its mythology in this way, the life goes out of it, temples become museums, and the link between the two perspectives is dissolved. Such a blight has certainly descended on the Bible and on a great part of the Christian cult. 
To bring the images back to life, one has to seek, not interest­ ing applications to modern affairs, but illuminating hints from the inspired past. When these are found, vast areas of half-dead iconography disclose again their permanently human meaning.*

**Is there any ground left for myth to grow out of? I think one of the most fertile grounds in modern day is the mysteries of Bitcoin. What gives it it's power is the secrecy by which it was incepted. It means that it's still possible but the requirements are different.

*Myth is but the penultimate; the ultimate is openness—that void, or being, beyond the categories 4—into which the mind must plunge alone and be dissolved. Therefore, God and the gods are only convenient means—themselves of the nature of the world of names and forms, though eloquent of, and ultimately conducive to, the ineffable. They are mere symbols to move and awaken the mind, and to call it past themselves.*

**In a sense we need to ignore our everyday experience in order to get closer to reality. The unfiltered view of the very fabric of reality. Myth is a powerful vehicle to getting there, it turns our psyche in precisely the right ways to go beyond ourselves. Our unconscious mind most likely has a less filtered view of reality, so that might be what we're actually getting closer to.

*Redemption consists in the return to superconscious­ ness and therewith the dissolution of the world. This is the great theme and formula of the cosmogonie cycle, the mythical image of the world's coming to manifestation and subsequent return into the nonmanifest condition. Equally, the birth, life, and death of the individual may be regarded as a descent into unconscious­ ness and return. The hero is the one who, while still alive, knows and represents the claims of the superconsciousness which throughout creation is more or less unconscious. The adventure of the hero represents the moment in his life when he achieved illumination—the nuclear moment when, while still alive, he found and opened the road to the light beyond the dark walls of our living death. 
And so it is that the cosmic symbols are presented in a spirit of thought-bewildering sublime paradox. The kingdom of God is within, yet without, also; God, however, is but a convenient means to wake the sleeping princess, the soul. Life is her sleep, death the awakening. The hero, the waker of his own soul, is himself but the convenient means of his own dissolution. God, the waker of the soul, is therewith his own immediate death.*

**I love the view of coming to life as falling asleep from the ultimate reality.

*The cosmogonie cycle is normally represented as repeating it­ self, world without end. During each great round, lesser dissolu­ tions are commonly included, as the cycle of sleep and waking 9 Supra, p. 81. 
10 Supra, pp. 38-39. 
242 THE U N I V E R S A L R O U N D revolves throughout a lifetime. According to an Aztec version, each of the four elements—water, earth, air, and fire—terminates a period of the world: the eon of the waters ended in deluge, that of the earth with an earthquake, that of air with a wind, and the present eon will be destroyed by flame.*

**I shouldn't interpret this too much with a metaphysical lense. The cosmogonic cycle literally talks about the creation of the universe but is probably better seen as a metaphor for the psyche. That is what we know and can know but not describe. We don't yet know enough about cosmos.

**The fact that most creation myths are round is interesting.

*The Hindus represent this mystery in the holy syllable AUM. 
Here the sound A represents waking consciousness, U dream consciousness, M deep sleep. The silence surrounding the syllable is the unknown: it is called simply "The Fourth."
1 6 The syllable itself is God as creator-preserver-destroyer, but the silence is God*

**I suddenly feel dumb for not having realized the significance of that syllable.

*The Jains conceive of time as an endless round. Time is pic-tured as a wheel with twelve spokes, or ages, classified in two sets of six. The first set is called the "descending" series (avasarpinï), and begins with the age of the superlative giant-couples. That paradisiac period endures for ten millions of ten millions of one hundred millions of one hundred million periods of countless years, and then yields slowly to the only half as blissful period when men and women are only four miles tall. In the third period—that of Rishabhanatha, first of the twenty-four world saviors—happiness is mixed with a little sorrow, and virtue with a little vice. At the conclusion of this period, men and women are no longer born together in couples to live to-gether as man and wife.*

**The mathematical touch makes it more interesting to me. The halving mechanism makes it related to the Golden ratio in mind.

*Myth remains, necessarily, within the cycle, but represents this cycle as surrounded and permeated by the silence. Myth is the revelation of a plenum of silence within and around every atom of existence. Myth is a directing of the mind and heart, by means of profoundly informed figurations, to that ultimate mys­ tery which fills and surrounds all existences. Even in the most comical and apparently frivolous of its moments, mythology is directing the mind to this unmanifest which is just beyond the eye.*

**Rather than being metaphysical it's deeply phenomenological. It's a deep exploration of one's own conscious experience, all its facets, and the silent space from which it emerges. Painting a cosmic picture of it puts a very sacred touch to it.

*The basic principle of all mythology is this of the beginning in the end. Creation myths are pervaded with a sense of the doom that is continually recalling all created shapes to the imperishable out of which they first emerged. The forms go forth powerfully, but inevitably reach their apogee, break, and return. Mythology, in this sense, is tragic in its view. But in the sense that it places our true being not in the forms that shatter but in the imperishable out of which they again immediately bubble forth, mythology is eminently untragical.
2 1 Indeed, wherever the mythological mood prevails, tragedy is impossible. A quality rather of dream prevails. True being, meanwhile, is not in the shapes but in the dreamer.*

**If you look at it not from our perspective as forms, then the end is beautiful because it's a return to the deepest ground of reality. 

---
Page: 343

*As in dream, the images range from the sublime to the ridicu­ lous. The mind is not permitted to rest with its normal evalua­ tions, but is continually insulted and shocked out of the assurance that now, at last, it has understood. Mythology is defeated when the mind rests solemnly with its favorite or traditional images, de­ fending them as though they themselves were the message that they communicate.*

**This is a powerful argument for being polytheistic. You want to look at the ineffable from multiple perspectives. Though I guess you don't want to lose depth through faith and conviction.

*From the void beyond all voids unfold the world-sustaining emanations, plantlike, mysterious. The tenth of the above series is night; the eighteenth, space or ether, the frame of the visible world; the nineteenth is the male-female polarity; the twentieth is the universe we see. Such a series suggests the depth beyond depth of the mystery of being. The levels correspond to the pro­ fundities sounded by the hero in his world-fathoming adventure; 
they number the spiritual strata known to the mind introverted in meditation. They represent the bottomlessness of the dark night of the soul*

**I wonder how consistent these explorations are between different shamanic traditions.

Page: 346

*The first effect of the cosmogonie emanations is the framing of the world stage of space; the second is the production of life within the frame: life polarized for self-reproduction under the dual form of the male and female. It is possible to represent the entire process in sexual terms, as a pregnancy and birth.*

**If you view it from the lense of consciousness, what does life, the male and the female mean?

*'But what am I afraid of? There is nothing but myself.' Whereupon his fear was gone. . . . 
"He was unhappy. That is why people are not happy when they are alone. He wanted a mate. He became as big as a woman and man embracing. He divided this body, which was himself, in two parts. From that there came husband and wife. . . . 
Therefore this human body (before one marries a wife) is like one of the halves of a split pea. . . . He united with her; and from that were born men.*

**Makes me think of a kind of creature that has divided his own personality into several people. It's one creature, and that creature wants to create more creatures. One weird way of doing that is by splitting up the reproductive roles into two. Could you have an n-step reproductive process? I don't know what purpose it'd serve. What's the purpose of going from one to two?

*The shell of the cosmic egg is the world frame of space, while the fer­ tile seed-power within typifies the inexhaustible life dynamism of nature. 
"Space is boundless by re-entrant form not by great extension. 
That which is is a shell floating in the infinitude of that which is not" This succinct formulation by a modern physicist, illustrat­ ing the world picture as he saw it in 1928, 3 2 gives precisely the sense of the mythological cosmic egg. Furthermore, the evolu­ tion of life, described by our modern science of biology, is the theme of the early stages of the cosmogonie cycle. Finally, the world destruction, which the physicists tell us must come with the exhaustion of our sun and ultimate running down of the whole cosmos, 3 3 stands presaged in the scar left by the fire of Tangaroa: the world-destructive effects of the creator-destroyer will increase gradually until, at last, in the second course of the cosmogonie cycle, all will devolve into the sea of bliss.*

**When you start mixing in real physics into myth the symbolism gets muddied.

*According to this mysticism of sexual love, the ultimate experience of love is a realization that beneath the illusion of two-ness dwells identity: "each is both." This realiza­ tion can expand into a discovery that beneath the multitudinous individualities of the whole surrounding universe—human, ani­ mal, vegetable, even mineral—dwells identity; whereupon the love experience becomes cosmic, and the beloved who first opened the vision is magnified as the mirror of creation. The man or woman knowing this experience is possessed of what Schopenhauer called "the science of beauty everywhere." He "goes up and down these worlds, eating what he desires, assum­ ing what forms he desires," and he sits singing the song of uni­ versal unity, which begins: "Oh, wonderful! Oh, wonderful! Oh, wonderful!"*

**Somehow we're participating in so much creation and death just by being. You're physical body is a cosmos of creatures, and the earth is full of such cosmoses. Going from duality to unity I suppose is the shortest description, it doesn't need to include more than two to show the point. 

---
Page: 360

*The myths never tire of illustrating the point that conflict in the created world is not what it seems. Tiamat, though slain and dismembered, was not thereby undone. Had the battle been viewed from another angle, the chaos-monster would have been seen to shatter of her own accord, and her fragments move to their respective stations. Marduk and his whole generation of di­ vinities were but particles of her substance. From the standpoint of those created forms all seemed accomplished as by a mighty arm, amid danger and pain. But from the center of the emanat­ ing presence, the flesh was yielded willingly, and the hand that carved it was ultimately no more than an agent of the will of the victim herself. 
Herein lies the basic paradox of myth: the paradox of the dual focus. Just as at the opening of the cosmogonie cycle it was pos­ sible to say "God is not involved," but at the same time "God is creator-preserver-destroyer," so now at this critical juncture, where the One breaks into the many, destiny "happens," but at the same time "is brought about." From the perspective of the source, the world is a majestic harmony of forms pouring into being, exploding, and dissolving. But what the swiftly passing creatures experience is a terrible cacaphony of battle cries and pain.*

**From the depths of our unconscious, consciousness creates separation of things into forms. It's described so violently I suppose because it takes the unity of all and shatters it. Though it's also the creation of all. It describes a constructive process of consciousness. But it also emphasizes that what we perceive in our consciousness is not to be mistaken for ultimate reality.

*The folk mythologies take up the story of creation only at the moment where the transcendental emanations break into spatial forms. Nevertheless, they do not differ from the great mythologies on any essential point in their evaluations of human circumstance. 
Their symbolic personages correspond in import—frequently also in trait and deed—to those of the higher iconographies, and the wonder world in which they move is precisely that of the greater revelations: the world and the age between deep sleep and wak­ ing consciousness, the zone where the One breaks into the mani­ fold and the many are reconciled in the One.*

**Folk mythologies feels like stories created to explain very local phenomena. And sometimes they're just used for perpetuating some moral or heuristic learned by the people. The local parts are not particularly universal.

*Still unborn was Vàinàmôinen; 
Still unborn the bard immortal. 
Vàinàmôinen, old and steadfast, Rested in his mother's body For the space of thirty summers, And the sum of thirty winters, Ever on the placid waters, And upon the foaming billows. 
So he pondered and reflected How he could continue living In a resting place so gloomy, In a dwelling far too narrow, Where he could not see the moonlight, Neither could behold the sunlight.*

**It almost feels like the description of a brain locked inside a skull.

*In mythologies emphasizing the maternal rather than the pa­ ternal aspect of the creator, this original female fills the world stage in the beginning, playing the roles that are elsewhere as­ signed to males. And she is virgin, because her spouse is the In­ visible Unknown.*

**It's great to get some context on the significance of the virgin birth.

Page: 372

*Before Vàinàmoinen—hero already in his birth—could make his way ashore, the ordeal of a second mother-womb remained to him, that of the elemental cosmic ocean. Unprotected now, he had to undergo the initiation of nature's fundamentally inhuman forces. On the level of water and wind he had to experience again what he already so well knew.*

**A succession of wombs to climb out of. Each level with scaled up challenges.

*The vista into depth closes over. The significant form of the human agony is lost to view. Society lapses into mistake and dis­ aster. The Little Ego has usurped the judgment seat of the Self. 
This is in myth a perpetual theme, in the voices of the prophets a familiar cry. The people yearn for some personality who, in a world of twisted bodies and souls, will represent again the lines of the incarnate image. We are familiar with the myth from our own tradition. It occurs everywhere, under a variety of guises. 
When the Herod figure (the extreme symbol of the misgovern­ ing, tenacious ego) has brought mankind to the nadir of spiri­ tual abasement, the occult forces of the cycle begin of themselves to move. In an inconspicuous village the maid is born who will maintain herself undefiled of the fashionable errors of her gener­ ation: a miniature in the midst of men of the cosmic woman who was the bride of the wind. Her womb, remaining fallow as the primordial abyss, summons to itself by its very readiness the original power that fertilized the void.*

**The maiden represents a new start in a mind that has become corrupt, that has been overtaken by the tyrant of earthly desire. Through the maiden we can reawaken. It's a portal for the divine to shine through.

*W E HAVE come two stages: first, from the immediate emana­ tions of the Uncreated Creating to the fluid yet timeless person­ ages of the mythological age; second, from these Created Creat­ ing Ones to the sphere of human history. The emanations have condensed, the field of consciousness constricted. Where formerly causal bodies were visible, now only their secondary effects come to focus in the little hard-fact pupil of the human eye. The cos­ mogonie cycle is now to be carried forward, therefore, not by the gods, who have become invisible, but by the heroes, more or less human in character, through whom the world destiny is real­ ized. This is the line where creation myths begin to give place to legend—as in the Book of Genesis, following the expulsion from the garden. Metaphysics yields to prehistory, which is dim and vague at first, but becomes gradually precise in detail. The he­ roes become less and less fabulous, until at last, in the final stages of the various local traditions, legend opens into the common day­ light of recorded time.*

**It's interesting to see how the closer we get to the known, the less fantastical it becomes. 

---
Page: 387

*But the makers of legend have seldom rested content to re­ gard the world's great heroes as mere human beings who broke past the horizons that limited their fellows and returned with such boons as any man with equal faith and courage might have found. On the contrary, the tendency has always been to endow the hero with extraordinary powers from the moment of birth, or even the moment of conception. The whole hero-life is shown to have been a pageant of marvels with the great central adven­ ture as its culmination. 
This accords with the view that herohood is predestined, rather than simply achieved, and opens the problem of the rela­ tionship of biography to character. Jesus, for example, can be regarded as a man who by dint of austerities and meditation 3 Giles, op. cit., p. 338; MacGowan, op. cit., pp. 6-8; Edouard Chavannes, Les mémoires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien (Paris, 1895-1905), Vol. I, pp. 25-36. See also John C. Ferguson, Chinese Mythology ("The Mythology of All Races," Vol. VIII, Boston, 1928), pp. 27-28, 29-31. 
C H I L D H O O D OF T H E H U M A N HERO attained wisdom; or on the other hand, one may believe that a god descended and took upon himself the enactment of a human career. The first view would lead one to imitate the master liter­ ally, in order to break through, in the same way as he, to the transcendent, redemptive experience. But the second states that the hero is rather a symbol to be contemplated than an example to be literally followed. The divine being is a revelation of the omnipotent Self, which dwells within us all. The contemplation of the life thus should be undertaken as a meditation on one's own immanent divinity, not as a prelude to precise imitation, the lesson being, not "Do thus and be good," but "Know this and be God."
4*

**I get kind of a knee-jerk reaction to preordained greatness but if you instead look at its meaning for the myth it starts to make more sense. The hero is a symbol to be contemplated, not imitated literally.

*In the present chapter, therefore, we shall consider first the miraculous childhood, by which it is shown that a special manifestation of the immanent divine principle has become in­ carnate in the world, and then, in succession, the various life roles through which the hero may enact his work of destiny. 
These vary in magnitude, according to the needs of the time. 
Stated in the terms already formulated, the hero's first task is to experience consciously the antecedent stages of the cosmo­ gonie cycle; to break back through the epochs of emanation. His second, then, is to return from that abyss to the plane of contem­ porary life, there to serve as a human transformer of demiurgic potentials.*

**Is the miraculous childhood just a representation of the rarity of finding enlightenment or even just the path to it?

*Each of these biographies exhibits the variously rationalized theme of the infant exile and return. This is a prominent feature in all legend, folk tale, and myth. Usually an effort is made to give it some semblance of physical plausibility. However, when the hero in question is a great patriarch, wizard, prophet, or incar­ nation, the wonders are permitted to develop beyond all bounds.*

**What does the exile signfiy? Is it a sign of how the current time rejects what the symbol means and how it needs to go through the journey to reveal itself properly to the psyche?

*The conclusion of the childhood cycle is the return or recogni­ tion of the hero, when, after the long period of obscurity, his true character is revealed. This event may precipitate a consider­ able crisis; for it amounts to an emergence of powers hitherto excluded from human life. Earlier patterns break to fragments or dissolve; disaster greets the eye. Yet after a moment of apparent havoc, the creative value of the new factor comes to view, and the world takes shape again in unsuspected glory. This theme of crucifixion-resurrection can be illustrated either on the body of the hero himself, or in his effects upon his world.*

**The hero as a child, is it akin to a new idea being born inside you and then coming to fruition?

*In sum: the child of destiny has to face a long period of obscu­ rity. This is a time of extreme danger, impediment, or disgrace. 
He is thrown inward to his own depths or outward to the un­ known; either way, what he touches is a darkness unexplored. 
And this is a zone of unsuspected presences, benign as well as malignant: an angel appears, a helpful animal, a fisherman, a hunter, crone, or peasant.*

**What does this represent in terms of consciousness? Is it a new idea that's growing inside you? It has to face the dangers of your current world view, and indeed everywhere it touches it makes you see that from a new perspective.

*The place of the hero's birth, or the remote land of exile from which he returns to perform his adult deeds among men, is the mid-point or navel of the world. Just as ripples go out from an underwater spring, so the forms of the universe expand in circles from this source.*

**Is the navel of the world something like the default mode network? It's the center formed by the balance of all your neurons. Or is it deeper? Is it perhaps the inner most layer of our consciousness?

*For the mythological hero is the champion not of things be­ come but of things becoming; the dragon to be slain by him is precisely the monster of the status quo: Holdfast, the keeper of the past. From obscurity the hero emerges, but the enemy is great and conspicuous in the seat of power; he is enemy, dragon, tyrant, because he turns to his own advantage the authority of his position. He is Holdfast not because he keeps the past but because he keeps. 
The tyrant is proud, and therein resides his doom. He is proud because he thinks of his strength as his own; thus he is in the clown role, as a mistaker of shadow for substance; it is his destiny to be tricked. The mythological hero, reappearing from the darkness that is the source of the shapes of the day, brings a knowledge of the secret of the tyrant's doom. With a gesture as simple as the pressing of a button, he annihilates the impressive configuration. The hero-deed is a continuous shattering of the crystallizations of the moment.*

**The hero is what fixes existential inertia, one of our perennial problems. The tyrant is existential inertia.

*The world period of the hero in human form begins only when villages and cities have expanded over the land. Many monsters remaining from primeval times still lurk in the outly­ ing regions, and through malice or desperation these set them­ selves against the human community. They have to be cleared away. Furthermore, tyrants of human breed, usurping to them­ selves the goods of their neighbors, arise, and are the cause of widespread misery. These have to be suppressed. The elemen­ tary deeds of the hero are those of the clearing of the field*

**To have your mind be represented by the world and cities is appropriate, it's a complex dynamical system that if it's perturbed the wrong way might collapse.

*She is the "other portion" of the hero himself—for "each is both": 
if his stature is that of world monarch she is the world, and if he is a warrior she is fame. She is the image of his destiny which he is to release from the prison of enveloping circumstance. But where he is ignorant of his destiny, or deluded by false consider­ ations, no effort on his part will overcome the obstacles.*

**Hearing it as the princess being part of the hero makes that role somehow more impressive and serious. The princess is the world, the fame, the reason, the purpose. The hero cannot do anything good without that also being there. I suppose a victory without a princess would represent a hollow and dead victory.

*The most eloquent and deep-driving of the traits in this color­ ful adventure of Cuchulainn is that of the unique, invisible path, which was opened to the hero with the rolling of the wheel and the apple. This is to be read as symbolic and instructive of the miracle of destiny. To a man not led astray from himself by sen­ timents stemming from the surfaces of what he sees, but coura­ geously responding to the dynamics of his own nature—to a man who is, as Nietzsche phrases it, "a wheel rolling of itself"— difficulties melt and the unpredictable highway opens as he goes.*

**Have the courage to see through what seems impossible. Have the courage to see and actuate your own potential.

*The hero blessed by the father returns to represent the father among men. As teacher (Moses) or as emperor (Huang Ti), his word is law. Since he is now centered in the source, he makes visible the repose and harmony of the central place. He is a reflection of the World Axis from which the concentric circles spread—the World Mountain, the World Tree—he is the perfect microcosmic mirror of the macrocosm. To see him is to perceive the meaning of existence. From his presence boons go out; his word is the wind of life.*

**Becoming at one with the invisible unknown, does this mean to achieve wisdom? To be a high fidelity reflection of the universe itself? Isn't it just ultimate conformity? Or is it to be able to hear and see the ripples of destiny? Let's not forget that wisdom is knowing what you don't know.

*No longer referring the boons of his reign to their transcendent source, the emperor breaks the stereoptic vision which it is his role to sustain. He is no longer the mediator between the two worlds. Man's perspective flattens to include only the human term of the equation, and the experience of a supernal power immedi­ ately fails. The upholding idea of the community is lost. Force is all that binds it. The emperor becomes the tyrant ogre (Herod-Nimrod), the usurper from whom the world is now to be saved.*

**Tyrants don't start out as tyrants.

*Stated in direct terms: the work of the hero is to slay the tena­ cious aspect of the father (dragon, tester, ogre king) and release 3 1 Adapted from Nivedita and Coomaraswamy, op. cit., pp. 236-237. 
T R A N S F O R M A T I O N S OF T H E HERO from its ban the vital energies that will feed the universe. "This can be done either in accordance with the Father's will or against his will; he [the Father] may 'choose death for his children's sake,' or it may be that the Gods impose the passion upon him, making him their sacrificial victim. These are not contradictory doctrines, but different ways of telling one and the same story; 
in reality, Slayer and Dragon, sacrificer and victim, are of one mind behind the scenes, where there is no polarity of contraries, but mortal enemies on the stage, where the everlasting war of the Gods and the Titans is displayed. In any case, the Dragon-Father remains a Pleroma, no more diminished by what he ex­ hales than he is increased by what he repossesses. He is the Death, on whom our life depends; and to the question 'Is Death one, or many?' the answer is made that 'He is one as he is there, but many as he is in his children here.' "*

**This endless cycle of death and rebirth is the way that progress is made. We move into a new mental paradigm only to realize its faults, or that some parts of it over time distort the mind. Then it is time for it to die and be reborn again. Both aspects are part of the same fabric, but the tyrant is painted as the enemy to make his death more palatable.

*Before we proceed to the last episode of the life, one more hero-type remains to be mentioned: the saint or ascetic, the world-renouncer. 
"Endowed with a pure understanding, restraining the self with firmness, turning away from sound and other objects, and abandoning love and hatred; dwelling in solitude, eating but little, controlling the speech, body, and mind, ever engaged in meditation and concentration, and cultivating freedom from pas­ sion; forsaking conceit and power, pride and lust, wrath and possessions, tranquil in heart, and free from ego—he becomes worthy of becoming one with the imperishable."
3 4 The pattern is that of going to the father, but to the unmani-fest rather than the manifest aspect: taking the step that the Bodhisattva renounced: that from which there is no return. Not the paradox of the dual perspective, but the ultimate claim of the unseen is here intended. The ego is burnt out. Like a dead leaf in a breeze, the body continues to move about the earth, but the soul has dissolved already in the ocean of bliss.*

**The problem with this path is that it doesn't revitalize the actual world. The lessons learned are not taken back from the other side. Having that said it seems like a perfectly fine path.

*The last act in the biography of the hero is that of the death or departure. Here the whole sense of the life is epitomized. Need­ less to say, the hero would be no hero if death held for him any terror; the first condition is reconciliation with the grave.*

**During the whole journey, death is accepted and seen for what it is. Not the end of something but the sounding of a new round about.

*"Thereupon The Blessed One entered the first trance; and ris­ ing from the first trance, he entered the second trance; and rising from the second trance, he entered the third trance; 
and rising from the third trance, he entered the fourth trance; 
and rising from the fourth trance, he entered the realm of the 335 T R A N S F O R M A T I O N S OF THE HERO infinity of space; and rising from the realm of the infinity of space, he entered the realm of the infinity of consciousness, and rising from the realm of the infinity of consciousness, he entered the realm of nothingness; and rising from the realm of nothing­ ness, he entered the realm of neither perception nor yet non-perception; and rising from the realm of neither perception nor yet non-perception, he arrived at the cessation of perception and sensation. 
"Thereupon the venerable Ananda spoke to the venerable Anuruddha as follows: 
" 'Reverend Anuruddha, The Blessed One has passed into Nirvana.' " 'Nay, brother Ananda, The Blessed One has not yet passed into Nirvana; he has arrived at the cessation of perception and sensation.' "Thereupon The Blessed One rising from the cessation of his perception and sensation, entered the realm of neither percep­ tion nor yet non-perception; and rising from the realm of neither perception or yet non-perception, he entered the realm of noth­ ingness; and rising from the realm of nothingness, he entered the realm of infinity of consciousness; and rising from the realm of infinity of consciousness, he entered the realm of the infinity of space; and rising from the realm of the infinity of space, he en­ tered the fourth trance; and rising from the fourth trance, he en­ tered the third trance; and rising from the third trance, he entered the second trance; and rising from the second trance, he entered the first trance; and rising from the first trance, he entered the se­ cond trance; and rising from the second trance, he entered the third trance; and rising from the third trance, he entered the fourth trance; and rising from the fourth trance, immediately The Blessed One passed into Nirvana."*

**It's like a creation myth in reverse. Where creation myths are about the step changes from underlying reality to consciousness.

*The Book of the Dead was buried with the mummy as a guide book to the perils of the difficult way, and chapters were recited at the time of burial.*

*THE mighty hero of extraordinary powers—able to lift Mount Govardhan on a finger, and to fill himself with the terrible glory of the universe—is each of us: not the physical self visible in the mirror, but the king within. Krishna declares: "I am the Self, seated in the hearts of all creatures. I am the beginning, the mid­ dle, and the end of all beings."
1 This, precisely, is the sense of the prayers for the dead, at the moment of personal dissolution: 
that the individual should now return to his pristine knowledge of the world-creative divinity who during life was reflected within his heart.*

**At this point the myth becomes less metaphorical it feels like. When you die you literally disintegrate into the fabric of reality.

*As the created form of the individual must dissolve, so that of the universe also: 
"When it is known that after the lapse of a hundred thousand years the cycle is to be renewed, the gods called Loka byuhas, in­ habitants of a heaven of sensual pleasure, wander about through the world, with hair let down and flying in the wind, weeping and wiping away their tears with their hands, and with their clothes red and in great disorder. And thus they make announcement: 
" 'Sirs, after the lapse of a hundred thousand years the cycle is to be renewed; this world will be destroyed; also the mighty ocean will dry up; and this broad earth, and Sumeru, the monarch of mountains, will be burnt up and destroyed—up to the Brahma world will the destruction of the world extend. Therefore, sirs, cultivate friendliness; cultivate compassion, joy, and indiffer­ ence; wait on your mothers; wait on your fathers; and honor your elders among your kinsfolk.' "This is called the Cyclic-Uproar."*

**Are the cycles always the same? Are they echoes of each other? What happens in-between?

*THERE is no final system for the interpretation of myths, and there will never be any such thing. Mythology is like the god Proteus, "the ancient one of the sea, whose speech is sooth." The god "will make assay, and take all manner of shapes of things that creep upon the earth, of water likewise, and of fierce fire burning."
1 The life-voyager wishing to be taught by Proteus must "grasp him steadfastly and press him yet the more," and at length he will appear in his proper shape. But this wily god never dis­ closes even to the skillful questioner the whole content of his wisdom. He will reply only to the question put to him, and what he discloses will be great or trivial, according to the question asked.*

**Symbols are what we need them to be when we need it. Symbols are transformative.

*In his life-form the individual is necessarily only a fraction and distortion of the total image of man. He is limited either as male or as female; at any given period of his life he is again limited as child, youth, mature adult, or ancient; furthermore, in his life-role he is necessarily specialized as craftsman, tradesman, ser­ vant, or thief, priest, leader, wife, nun, or harlot; he cannot be all. 
Hence, the totality—the fullness of man—is not in the separate member, but in the body of the society as a whole; the individual can be only an organ. From his group he has derived his tech­ niques of life, the language in which he thinks, the ideas on which he thrives; through the past of that society descended the genes that built his body. If he presumes to cut himself off, ei­ ther in deed or in thought and feeling, he only breaks connection with the sources of his existence.*

**Why limit it only to humans? The variety of all life is nature putting on many different faces.

*The hogan, or mud hut, of the Navahos of New Mexico and Arizona, is constructed on the plan of the Navaho image of the cosmos. 
The entrance faces east. The eight sides represent the four direc­ tions and the points between. Every beam and joist corresponds to an element in the great hogan of the all-embracing earth and sky. And since the soul of man itself is regarded as identical in form with the universe, the mud hut is a representation of the basic harmony of man and world, and a reminder of the hidden life-way of perfection.*

**What if all our architecture was infused with this humanity? Right now our houses are perversely functional and lack any spirit.

*All participate in the ceremonial according to rank and function. The whole society becomes visible to itself as an imperishable living unit. Generations of individuals pass, like anonymous cells from a living body; but the sustaining, timeless form remains. By an enlargement of vision to embrace this super-individual, each discovers himself enhanced, enriched, supported, and magnified. His role, however unimpressive, is seen to be in­ trinsic to the beautiful festival-image of man—the image, potential yet necessarily inhibited, within himself.*

**Tradition is in a sense an immortal construct that we attach parts of ourselves to. These kinds of constructs are the beings who we are components of.

*The aim is not to see, but to realize that one is, that essence; then one is free to wander as that essence in the world. Furthermore: the world too is of that essence. The essence of oneself and the essence of the world: these two are one. Hence separateness, withdrawal, is no longer necessary. Wherever the hero may wander, whatever he may do, he is ever in the presence of his own essence—for he has the perfected eye to see. There is no separateness. Thus, just as the way of social participation may lead in the end to a realiza­ tion of the All in the individual, so that of exile brings the hero to the Self in all. 
Centered in this hub-point, the question of selfishness or al­ truism disappears. The individual has lost himself in the law and been reborn in identity with the whole meaning of the universe.*

**It's natural for there to be a journey, though the sudden realization will be that you're part of it and it is part of you.

*The center of gravity, that is to say, of the realm of mystery and danger has definitely shifted. For the primitive hunting peoples of 360 T H E HERO TODAY those remotest human millenniums when the sabertooth tiger, the mammoth, and the lesser presences of the animal kingdom were the primary manifestations of what was alien—the source at once of danger, and of sustenance—the great human problem was to become linked psychologically to the task of sharing the wilderness with these beings. An unconscious identification took place, and this was finally rendered conscious in the half-human, half-animal, figures of the mythological totem-ancestors. The an­ imals became the tutors of humanity. Through acts of literal imi­ tation—such as today appear only on the children's playground (or in the madhouse)—an effective annihilation of the human ego was accomplished and society achieved a cohesive organiza­ tion. Similarly, the tribes supporting themselves on plant-food became cathected to the plant; the life-rituals of planting and reaping were identified with those of human procreation, birth, and progress to maturity. Both the plant and the animal worlds, however, were in the end brought under social control. Where­ upon the great field of instructive wonder shifted—to the skies— and mankind enacted the great pantomime of the sacred moon-king, the sacred sun-king, the hieratic, planetary state, and the symbolic festivals of the world-regulating spheres.*

**We mythologize that which powers our lives. It's no wonder that the latest mythology to emerge is one related to money and individualism.

*The problem of mankind today, therefore, is precisely the op­ posite to that of men in the comparatively stable periods of those great co-ordinating mythologies which now are known as lies. 
3 Nietzsche, Thus Spake Zarathustra, 1. 22. 3. 
358 T H E HERO TODAY Then all meaning was in the group, in the great anonymous forms, none in the self-expressive individual; today no meaning is in the group—none in the world: all is in the individual. But there the meaning is absolutely unconscious. One does not know toward what one moves. One does not know by what one is pro­ pelled. The lines of communication between the conscious and the unconscious zones of the human psyche have all been cut, and we have been split in two.*

**Will we look back at our individualistic period with disdain for our foolishness in thinking that we can transcend the psyche using the psyche? As using a scissor to try and cut itself? 

**Is worshipping the individual not the same thing as narcissism?

*The modern hero, the modern individual who dares to heed the call and seek the mansion of that presence with whom it is our whole destiny to be atoned, cannot, indeed must not, wait for his community to cast off its slough of pride, fear, rational­ ized avarice, and sanctified misunderstanding. "Live," Nietzsche says, "as though the day were here." It is not society that is to guide and save the creative hero, but precisely the reverse. And so every one of us shares the supreme ordeal—carries the cross of the redeemer—not in the bright moments of his tribe's great victories, but in the silences of his personal despair.*

**No matter how deep in the shit the world is, all you can do is try to move it in the right direction. Step by step, day by day.
