*The ability of fungi to prosper in such a variety of habitats depends on their diverse metabolic abilities. Metabolism is the art of chemical transformation. Fungi are metabolic wi?ards and can e?plore, scavenge, and salvage ingeniously, their abilities rivaled only by bacteria.*

**It's not so much that fungi have abilities as having these metabolic abilities necessitates you looking like a fungi.

*A species isolated from mining waste is one of the most radiation-resistant organisms ever discovered and may help to clean up nuclear waste sites. The blasted nuclear reactor at Chernobyl is home to a large population of such fungi. A number of these radio-tolerant species even grow toward radioactive “hot” particles, and appear to be able to harness radiation as a source of energy, as plants use the energy in sunlight.*

**Geologically it wouldn't take Gaia that long to cleanup after a nuclear holocaust. She would invent new species of plants, fungi and animals that clean things up. Humans were invented to cleanup the energy stored in coal and oil.

*Spores are found in clouds and influence the weather by triggering the formation of the water droplets that form rain and the ice crystals that form snow, sleet, and hail.*

**How do they do it?

*The mycelium of some fungal species is electrically e?citable and conducts waves of electrical activity along hyphae, analogous to the electrical impulses in animal nerve cells.*

**Circuits are so useful they've been invented several times independently.

*Their metabolic ingenuity allows fungi to forge a wide variety of relationships. Whether in their roots or shoots, plants have relied on fungi for nutrition and defense for as long as there have been plants. Animals, too, depend on fungi.*

**What do fungi rely on? Or they at the bottom of the stack?

Page: 14

*This is not unusual: Although fungi have long been lumped together with plants, they are actually more closely related to animals—an e?ample of the kind of category mistake that researchers regularly make in their struggle to understand fungal lives. At a molecular level, fungi and humans are similar enough to benefit from many of the same biochemical innovations. When we use drugs produced by fungi, we are often borrowing a fungal solution and rehousing it within our own bodies.*

**I really have no idea what fungi is. To be closer to animals than plants seems wild.

*Fungal solutions don’t stop at human health. Radical fungal technologies can help us respond to some of the many problems that arise from ongoing environmental devastation. Antiviral compounds produced by fungal mycelium reduce colony collapse disorder in honeybees. Voracious fungal appetites can be deployed to break down pollutants, such as crude oil from oil spills, in a process known as mycoremediation. In mycofiltration, contaminated water is passed through mats of mycelium, which filter out heavy metals and break down to?ins. In mycofabrication, building materials and te?tiles are grown out of mycelium and replace plastics and leather in many applications. Fungal melanins, the pigments produced by radio-tolerant fungi, are a promising new source of radiation-resistant biomaterials.*

**How do fungi learn? What kind of epigenetic capabilities do they have? Are they evolving in the same way as animals or are they more similar to bacteria and viruses or do they do their own thing?

*As the weeks went by, it continued to happen— customers returned to say the traffic had seemed louder than it was before, the streetlights brighter, the patterns on the sidewalk more fascinating, the rain more refreshing. The magic tricks were changing the way people e?perienced the world.
David e?plained to me why he thought this happened. Our perceptions work in large part by e?pectation. It takes less cognitive effort to make sense of the world using preconceived images updated with a small amount of new sensory information than to constantly form entirely new perceptions from scratch. It is our preconceptions that create the blind spots in which magicians do their work. By attrition, coin tricks loosen the grip of our e?pectations about the way hands and coins work. Eventually, they loosen the grip of our e?pectations on our perceptions more generally. On leaving the restaurant, the sky looked different because the diners saw the sky as it was there and then, rather than as they e?pected it to be. Tricked out of our e?pectations, we fall back on our senses. What’s astonishing is the gulf between what we e?pect to find and what we find when we actually look.*

**I wonder if part of the psychedelic effect is immediate removal of viewing the world through expectations? 

**I wonder how hackable our expectations are. Darren Brown is very good but I suspect we're susceptible in ways that are hard to grasp at small scales and time frames. 

---
Page: 20

*Fungi, too, trick us out of our preconceptions. Their lives and behaviors are startling. The more I’ve studied fungi, the more my e?pectations have loosened and the more familiar concepts have started to appear unfamiliar.
Two fast-growing fields of biological in?uiry have helped me both navigate these states of surprise and provide frameworks that have guided my e?ploration of the fungal world.*

**It's not specific to Fungi, it's true for any fascinating topic, it's about the way you relate to the topic. If you dive deep enough you'll find magic anywhere.

*They guide the development of our bodies and immune systems and influence our behavior. If not kept in check, they can cause illnesses and even kill us. We are not a special case. Even bacteria have viruses within them (a nanobiome?). Even viruses can contain smaller viruses (a picobiome?). Symbiosis is a ubi?uitous feature of life.*

**There are so many layers to our capabilities, few of which we honestly consider when thinking about building artificial life. What we do most of the time is shallow and arrogant. I suspect that we'll need to let go of control if we want to create life. Turing completeness is fine but you won't get anything other than a computer from it, what you need are errors and chaos. What you need is actually both, the chaos and the order.

*There was something embarrassing about admitting that the tangle of our unfounded con?ectures, fantasies, and metaphors might have helped shape our research. Regardless, imagination forms part of the everyday business of in?uiring. Science isn’t an e?ercise in cold-blooded rationality. Scientists are—and have always been— emotional, creative, intuitive, whole human beings, asking ?uestions about a world that was never made to be catalogued and systemati?ed. Whenever I asked what these fungi were doing and designed studies to try and understand their behaviors, I necessarily imagined them.*

**The fact that conjecture is so stigmatized means that the scientific community is not thinking from first principles and are being intellectually dishonest. 

---
Page: 26

*I make no claims about the factual validity of these visions. They are at best plausible and at worst delirious nonsense. Not even wrong.
Nonetheless, I learned a valuable lesson. The way I had grown accustomed to thinking about fungi involved abstract “interactions” between organisms that actually looked like the diagrams schoolteachers drew on the board:
semiautomatic entities that behaved according to an early-nineties ?ame Boy logic. However, the LSD had forced me to admit that I had an imagination and I now saw fungi differently. I wanted to understand fungi, not by reducing them to ticking, spinning, bleeping mechanisms, as we so often do. Rather, I wanted to let these organisms lure me out of my well-worn patterns of thought, to imagine the possibilities they face, to let them press against the limits of my understanding, to give myself permission to be ama?ed—and confused—by their entangled lives.*

**Sometimes the model occlude everything that's important. They anchor you to knowledge and explanations that are false.

*Truffles are spore-producing organs, analogous to the seed-producing fruit of a plant. Spores evolved to allow fungi to disperse themselves, but underground their spores can’t be caught by air currents and are invisible to the eyes of animals.
Their solution is to smell. But to smell above the olfactory racket of a forest is no small task. Forests are crisscrossed with smells, each a potential fascination or distraction to an animal nose. Truffles must be pungent enough for their scent to penetrate the layers of soil and enter the air, distinctive enough for an animal to take note amid the ambient smellscape, and delicious enough for that animal to seek it out, dig it up, and eat it.
Every visual disadvantage that truffles face—being entombed in the soil, difficult to spot once unearthed, and visually unappealing once spotted— they make up for with smell.*

**Harsh conditions produce amazing features. If you want to evolve interesting things you need an interesting environment. An interesting problem to solve. Our AI algorithms are only as interesting as the problems they try to solve. We don't know our own environment and mix of problems we need to solve, that's why we train our AI in simple and uninteresting environments.

*THE HUMAN SENSE of smell is e?traordinary. Our eyes can distinguish several million colors, our ears can distinguish half a million tones, but our noses can distinguish well over a trillion different odors. Humans can detect virtually all volatile chemicals ever tested. We outperform rodents and dogs in detecting certain odors, and we can follow scent trails. Smells feature in our choice of se?ual partners and in our ability to detect fear, an?iety, or aggression in others. And smell is woven into the fabric of our memories; it is common for people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder to have olfactory flashbacks.
Noses are finely tuned instruments. Your olfactory sense can split comple? mi?tures into their constituent chemicals, ?ust as a prism can split white light into its constituent colors. To do this, it must detect the precise arrangement of atoms within a molecule. Mustard smells mustardy because of bonds between nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur. Fish smells fishy because of bonds between nitrogen and hydrogen. Bonds between carbon and nitrogen smell metallic and oily.*

**I thought our eyes had the greatest resolution of our senses. Is the fact that we can distinguish more types of smells related to our capacity for language? What does fear and anxiety smell like?

---
Page: 37

*The smell of a truffle is made up of a flock of different molecules drifting in formation—more than a hundred in white truffles and around fifty in the other most popular species. These elaborate bou?uets are energetically costly and are unlikely to have evolved unless they served some purpose.*

**Smells are incredible. I wonder if the nose parses each unique combination of molecules or if it can distinguish each molecules within a combination.

*There are two key moves by which fungal hyphae become a mycelial network. First, they branch. Second, they fuse. (The process by which hyphae merge with each other is known as “anastomosis,” which in ?reek means “to provide with a mouth.”) If hyphae couldn’t branch, one hypha could never become many. If hyphae couldn’t fuse with one another, they would not be able to grow into comple? networks. However, before they fuse, hyphae must find other hyphae, which they do by attracting one another, a phenomenon known as “homing.” Fusion between hyphae is the linking stitch that makes mycelium mycelium, the most basic networking act. In this sense, the mycelium of any fungus arises from its ability to attract itself to itself.*

**Complex structures can arise from very simple rules. 

---
Page: 42

*More than the architecture of roots has to change for a fungus to bond with a plant. In response to each other’s distinctive chemical profiles, signaling cascades ripple through plant and fungal cells, activating suites of genes. Both reorient their metabolisms and developmental programs. Fungi release chemicals that suspend their plant partners’ immune responses, without which they can’t get close enough to form symbiotic structures.
Once established, mycorrhi?al partnerships continue to develop.
Connections between hyphae and roots are dynamic, formed and reformed as root tips and fungal hyphae get old and die. These are relationships that ceaselessly remodel themselves. If you could place your olfactory epithelium into the soil, it would feel like the performance of a ?a?? group, with the players listening, interacting, responding to one another in real time.*

**What does a tree's immune system look like?

*The methods fungi use to hunt nematodes are grisly and diverse. It is a habit that has evolved multiple times—many fungal lineages have reached a similar conclusion but in different ways. Some fungi grow adhesive nets, or branches to which nematodes stick. Some use mechanical means, producing hyphal nooses that inflate in a tenth of a second when touched, ensnaring their prey. Some—including the commonly cultivated oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus)—produce hyphal stalks capped with a single to?ic droplet that paraly?es nematodes, giving the hypha enough time to grow through their mouth and digest the worm from the inside. Others produce spores that can swim through the soil, chemically drawn toward nematodes, to which they bind. Once attached, the spores sprout and the fungus harpoons the worm with speciali?ed hyphae known as “gun cells.”*

**Gaia might recruit fungi to trim down the human locusts.

*When trying to understand the interactions of nonhuman organisms, it is easy to flip between these two perspectives: that of the inanimate behavior of preprogrammed robots on the one hand, and that of rich, lived human e?perience on the other. Framed as brainless organisms, lacking the basic apparatus re?uired to have even a simple kind of “e?perience,” fungal interactions are no more than automatic responses to a series of biochemical triggers. Yet the mycelium of truffle fungi, like that of most fungal species, actively senses and responds to its surroundings in unpredictable ways.
Their hyphae are chemically irritable, responsive, e?citable. It is this ability to interpret the chemical emissions of others that allows fungi to negotiate a series of comple? trading relationships with trees; to knead away at stores of nutrients in the soil; to have se?; to hunt; or to fend off attackers.*

**At what point does an organism gain personhood? Whatever life is doing, it's clear that it creates interesting behavior that adapts and plays with itself.

*Mycelial coordination is difficult to understand because there is no center of control. If we cut off our head or stop our heart, we’re finished. A mycelial network has no head and no brain. Fungi, like plants, are decentrali?ed organisms. There are no operational centers, no capital cities, no seats of government. Control is dispersed: Mycelial coordination takes place both everywhere at once and nowhere in particular. A fragment of mycelium can regenerate an entire network, meaning that a single mycelial individual—if you’re brave enough to use that word—is potentially immortal.*

**It creates an incredibly resilient and flexible system, at the cost of efficiency gained by division of labor.

*The more of their surroundings that hyphae can touch, the more they can consume. The difference between animals and fungi is simple:
Animals put food in their bodies, whereas fungi put their bodies in the food.*

**They're master spreaders. Organisms discover approximate different mathematical truths depending on their niche, in fact the niche is created because of the hacks they find. 

---
Page: 58

*A mycelial network is a map of a fungus’s recent history and is a helpful reminder that all life-forms are in fact ?rocesses not things. The “you” of five years ago was made from different stuff than the “you” of today. Nature is an event that never stops. As William Bateson, who coined the word genetics, observed, “We commonly think of animals and plants as matter, but they are really systems through which matter is continually passing.” When we see an organism, from a fungus to a pine tree, we catch a single moment in its continual development.*

**If you zoom into any part of an animal it's a bunch of things mucking around. Kind of reminds of the tall guy joke where there are two dwarfs, one standing on the other. The animal is an emergent property of a bunch of cells and particles in motion. Reminds me of birdflocks too.

*“Women ?athering Mushrooms” is an e?ample of musical polyphony.
Polyphony is singing more than one part, or telling more than one story, at the same time. Unlike the harmonies in a barbershop ?uartet, the voices of the women never weld into a unified front. No voice surrenders its individual identity. Nor does any one voice steal the show. There is no front woman, no soloist, no leader. If the recording was played to ten people and they were asked to sing the tune back, each would sing something different.
Mycelium is polyphony in bodily form. Each of the women’s voices is a hyphal tip, e?ploring a soundscape for itself. Although each is free to wander, their wanderings can’t be seen as separate from the others. There is no main voice. There is no lead tune. There is no central planning.
Nonetheless, a form emerges.*

**It's like the sit on each other's lap in a circle phenomena.

*The best way to appreciate flow within mycelium is to watch its contents shuttle around the network. In 2013, a group of researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles treated mycelium so that they could visuali?e cellular structures moving within the hyphae. Their videos show hordes of nuclei surging along. In some hyphae they travel faster than in others, in some they travel in different directions. Sometimes traffic ?ams form and nuclear traffic is rerouted on hyphal slip channels. Streams of nuclei merge with each other. Rhythmic pulses of nuclei—“nuclear comets”—rush along, branching at ?unctions and darting down side ducts. It is a scene of “nuclear anarchy,” as one of the researchers wryly observed.*

**I wonder if the network properties and mechanics of mycelium can be applied to IT network and network theory in general. Have fungi explored anything we haven't explored? 

---
Page: 63

*Fungal lives are lived in a flood of sensory information. And somehow, hyphae—piloted by their tips—are able to integrate these many data streams and determine a suitable tra?ectory for growth. Humans, like most animals, use brains to integrate sensory data and decide on the best course of action. Accordingly, we tend to look for particular places where integration might take place. We like a where, but with plants and fungi, asking “where” only gets us so far. There are different parts of a mycelial network or a plant, but they aren’t uni?ue. There are many of everything.
How, then, do sensory data streams come together within a mycelial network? How do brainless organisms link perception with action?*

**Maximum decentralization means that every part is as capable as any other part. An organization might not need a brain to be effective in the world. When does a fungi strategy make more sense than an animal strategy? Perhaps when you're able to stay in place and grow outwards without having to make leaps?

**Fungi don't have division of labor, is it an advantage or a disadvantage?

*Olsson set up the rig and placed a block of wood onto the mycelium several centimeters from the electrodes. What he found was e?traordinary.
When the wood came into contact with the mycelium, the firing rate of the impulses doubled. When he removed the block of wood, the firing rate returned to normal. To make sure that the fungi weren’t responding to the weight of the wooden block, he placed an inedible plastic block of the same si?e and weight onto the mycelium. The fungus didn’t respond.*

**By modulating the frequency of the electrical impulses you can transmit any possible information. With fine enough sensors they should be able to label and differentiate between just about anything. Where do they store the meaning of every sensory pattern?

**Is there a rhythm to the frequencies? Rhythm can create high level patterns as well, and sometimes the out of beat parts are the most informative.

*For Adamat?ky, the point of fungal computers is not to replace silicon chips. Fungal reactions are too slow for that. Rather, he thinks humans could use mycelium growing in an ecosystem as a “large-scale environmental sensor.” Fungal networks, he reasons, are monitoring a large number of data streams as part of their everyday e?istence. If we could plug into mycelial networks and interpret the signals they use to process information, we could learn more about what was happening in an ecosystem. Fungi could report changes in soil ?uality, water purity, pollution, or any other features of the environment that they are sensitive to.*

**What a western way to appreciate the beauty, and complexity of nature. Demystify everything. 

---
Page: 68

*there could be other ways to regulate electrical impulses in mycelial networks to create “brain-like circuits, gates, and oscillators.” In some fungi, hyphae are divided into compartments by pores, which can be sensitively regulated. Opening or closing a pore changes the strength of the signal that passes from one compartment to another, whether chemical, pressure, or electrical. If sudden changes in the electrical charge within a hyphal compartment could open or close a pore, Olsson mused, a burst of impulses could change the way subse?uent signals passed along the hypha and form a simple learning loop. What’s more, hyphae branch. If two impulses converged on one spot, they would both influence pore conductivity, integrating signals from different branches.
“You do not need much knowledge of how computers work to reali?e that such systems can create decision gates,”*

**This is the answer to the memory and learning part. How much knowledge is stored genetically for fungi? How much is stored in their biomelectric patterns?

*Charles Darwin, writing in 1871, took a pragmatic line. “Intelligence is based on how efficient a species becomes at doing the things they need to survive.” It is a perspective that has been echoed by many contemporary biologists and philosophers. The Latin root of the word intelligence means “to choose between.” Many types of brainless organisms—plants, fungi, and slime molds included—respond to their environments in fle?ible ways, solve problems, and make decisions between alternative courses of action.
Comple? information processing is evidently not restricted to the inner workings of brains. Some use the term “swarm intelligence” to describe the problem-solving behavior of brainless systems. Others suggest that the behavior of these network-based life-forms can be thought of as arising from “minimal” or “basal” cognition, and argue that the ?uestion we should ask is not whether an organism has cognition or not. Rather, we should assess the degree to which an organism might be cogni?ant. In all these views, intelligent behaviors can arise without brains. A dynamic and responsive network is all that’s needed.*

**To what degree does the intelligence live in the environment as opposed to the agent in the environment? It somehow feels like the agent is the instrument and the environment is the musician. That would explain the lack of life in neural networks, they're isolated from the real world. Getting prompts fed to them is about as low fidelity as it can get.

Page: 70

*Traditionally, intelligence and cognition have been defined in human terms as something that re?uires at least a brain and, more usually, a mind. Cognitive science emerged from the study of humans and so naturally placed the human mind at the center of its in?uiry. Without a mind, the classical e?amples of cognitive processes— language, logic, reasoning, recogni?ing oneself in a mirror—seem impossible. All re?uire high-level mental functioning. But how we define intelligence and cognition is a ?uestion of taste. For many, the brain-centric view is too limited. The idea that a neat line can be drawn that separates nonhumans from humans with “real minds” and “real comprehension” has been curtly dismissed by the philosopher Daniel Dennett as an “archaic myth.” Brains didn’t evolve their tricks from scratch, and many of their characteristics reflect more ancient processes that e?isted long before recogni?able brains arose.*

**I would love to hear Michael Levin riff on this.

*The researchers wondered whether, if they trained a flatworm to remember features of its environment and then cut off its head, it would retain the memory when it has grown a new head and brain. Remarkably, the answer is yes. The flatworms’ memory appeared to reside in a part of their body outside the brain. These e?periments suggest that even within the body of brain-dependent animals, the fle?ible networks that underpin comple? behaviors need not be limited to a small region inside the head. There are other e?amples. Most nerves in octopuses are not found in the brain, for instance, but are distributed throughout their bodies. A large number are found in the tentacles, which can e?plore and taste their surroundings without involving the brain. Even when amputated, tentacles are able to reach and grasp.*

**How much conscious experience is there without the head? 

---
Page: 77

*Most worrisome for ta?onomists—working hard to order life into neat lines of descent—was the prospect that a single organism could contain two separate lineages. Following Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, first published in 1859, species were understood to arise by diverging from one another. Their evolutionary lineages forked, like the branches of a tree. The trunk of the tree forked into branches, which forked into smaller branches, which forked into twigs. Species were the leaves on the twigs of the tree of life. However, the dual hypothesis suggested that lichens were bodies composed of organisms with ?uite different origins.
Within lichens, branches of the tree of life that had been diverging for hundreds of millions of years were doing something entirely une?pected:
converging.*

**Life doesn't care about our taxonomies.

*Lichens mine minerals from rock in a twofold process known as “weathering.” First, they physically break up surfaces by the force of their growth. Second, they deploy an arsenal of powerful acids and mineral-binding compounds to dissolve and digest the rock. Lichens’ ability to weather makes them a geological force, yet they do more than dissolve the physical features of the world. When lichens die and decompose, they give rise to the first soils in new ecosystems. Lichens are how the inanimate mineral mass within rocks is able to cross over into the metabolic cycles of the living. A portion of the minerals in your body is likely to have passed through a lichen at some point. Whether on tombstones in a graveyard or encased within slabs of Antarctic granite, lichens are go-betweens that inhabit the boundary dividing life and nonlife. Looking out from the Ca?er at the rocky Canadian coastline, this becomes clear. Above the tideline, it is only after several meters of lichens and mosses that larger trees start to appear, rooted in crevices well beyond the water’s reach where young soils have been able to form.*

**I'd say this would be one of the first steps in terraforming a planet.

Page: 82

*Before hori?ontal gene transfer was discovered, bacteria, like all other organisms, were understood to be biological islands. ?enomes were closed systems. There was no way to take on new DNA midway through a lifetime, to ac?uire genes that had evolved “off-site.” Hori?ontal gene transfer changes this picture and shows bacterial genomes to be cosmopolitan places, made up of genes that had evolved separately for millions of years. Hori?ontal gene transfer implied, as lichens had before, that branches of the evolutionary tree that had long since diverged were able to converge within the body of a single organism.*

**It makes for early systems to be open and more hackable. They haven't had time to harden their defenses.

Page: 84

*The capacity of lichens to survive in space has since been demonstrated in a number of studies, and the findings are broadly the same. The hardiest lichen species can recover their metabolic activity in full within twenty-four hours of being rehydrated and are able to repair much of the “space-induced” damage they may have sustained. In fact, the toughest species— Circinaria gyrosa—has such high survival rates that three recent studies decided to e?pose samples to even higher levels of radiation than they receive in space, to test them to their “uttermost limits of survival.” Sure enough, a dose of radiation could kill the lichens, but the amount re?uired to disrupt their cells was enormous. Lichen samples e?posed to si?
kilograys of gamma irradiation—si? times the standard dose for food sterili?ation in the United States and twelve thousand times the lethal dose for humans—were entirely untroubled. When the dose was doubled to twelve kilograys—two and a half times the lethal dose for tardigrades—the lichens’ ability to reproduce was impaired, although they survived and continued to photosynthesi?e with no apparent problems.*

**Did Cixin Liu get inspiration for his aliens from lichen?

*The idea that eukaryotes had arisen “by fusion and merger” had drifted in and out of biological thought since the start of the twentieth century, but it had remained at the margins of “polite biological society.” By 1967, little had changed, and Margulis’s manuscript was re?ected fifteen times before it was finally accepted. After publication, her ideas were vigorously opposed, as similar suggestions had been before. (In 1970, the microbiologist Roger Stanier waspishly remarked that Margulis’s “evolutionary speculation…can be considered a relatively harmless habit, like eating peanuts, unless it assumes the form of an obsession; then it becomes a vice.”) However, in the 1970s Margulis was proved correct. New genetic tools revealed that mitochondria and chloroplasts had indeed started off as free-living bacteria.*

**The arrogance necessary for dismissing someone without thinking is disgusting. Every field of science is at the beginning of infinity, paradigms will keep shifting forever.

*Among the biggest implications of the endosymbiotic theory is that whole suites of abilities have been ac?uired in a flash, in evolutionary terms, ready-evolved, from organisms that are not one’s parents, nor one’s species, kingdom, or even domain. Lederberg demonstrated that bacteria can hori?ontally ac?uire genes. The endosymbiotic theory proposed that single-celled organisms had hori?ontally ac?uired entire bacteria.
Hori?ontal gene transfer transformed bacterial genomes into cosmopolitan places; endosymbiosis transformed cells into cosmopolitan places. The ancestors of all modern eukaryotes hori?ontally ac?uired a bacterium with a pree?isting ability to make energy from o?ygen. Likewise, the ancestors of today’s plants hori?ontally ac?uired bacteria with the ability to photosynthesi?e, ready-evolved.*

**It's easy to draw parallels to companies acquiring other companies. Or a team acquiring a new member.

*Lichens don’t reenact the origin of the eukaryotic cell e?actly, but as ?oward remarks, they certainly “rhyme” with it. Lichens are cosmopolitan bodies, a place where lives meet. A fungus can’t photosynthesi?e by itself, but by partnering with an alga or photosynthetic bacterium it can ac?uire this ability hori?ontally. Similarly, an alga or photosynthetic bacterium can’t grow tough layers of protective tissue or digest rock, but by partnering with a fungus it gains access to these capabilities—suddenly. Together, these ta?onomically remote organisms build composite life-forms capable of entirely new possibilities. By comparison with plant cells that can’t be parted from their chloroplasts, lichens’ relationships are open. This gives them fle?ibility.*

**The interoperability of life is interesting. It has limits, and the limits seem to involve geometry.

Page: 88

*It is well-known that the ability of lichens to survive e?treme conditions depends on them entering a state of suspended animation—some studies have found that they can be successfully resuscitated after ten years of dehydration. If their tissues are dehydrated then free?ing, thawing, and heating don’t cause much damage. Dehydration also protects them from the most ha?ardous conse?uence of cosmic rays: highly reactive free radicals, produced when radiation cleaves water molecules in two, that damage the structure of DNA.*

**Is this survival strategy possible for animals? Is it their simplicity that allows it to happen? It feels like our body's dependence on blood would prevent us from doing it.

*The record-holding lichen lives in Swedish Lapland and is more than nine thousand years old.*

**Do lichens have memories? Do they store knowledge? In that case I wonder what the oldest lichen would be able to tell us.

Page: 91

*Lichens have evolved independently between nine and twelve times since. Today, one in five of all known fungal species form lichens, or “licheni?e.”*

**This means that the pattern they're embodying is a common one in the information space of viable life.

*Not ?ust any fungus could partner with any alga, however. One critical condition had to be fulfilled for a symbiotic relationship to arise: Each partner had to be able to do something that the other couldn’t achieve on its own. The identity of the partners didn’t matter so much as their ecological fit. In the words of the evolutionary theorist W. Ford Doolittle, it was “the song, not the singer” that appeared to be important. This finding sheds light on lichens’ ability to survive in e?treme conditions. As ?oward points out, lichens by their nature are a kind of “shotgun marriage” that arises in conditions too severe for either partner to survive alone. Whenever it was that lichens occurred for the first time, their very e?istence implies that life outside the lichen was less bearable, that together they were able to sing a metabolic “song” that neither can sing in isolation. Viewed in this way, lichens’ e?tremophilia, their ability to live life on the edge, is as old as lichens themselves and a direct conse?uence of their symbiotic way of life.*

**How do they know the capability of the other? Do they try and it fails? Does the capabilities come in shapes that make them geometrically incompatible even before trying?

*Lichens are a product less of their parts than of the e?changes between those parts. Lichens are stabili?ed networks of relationships; they never stop licheni?ing; they are verbs as well as nouns.*

**So are we, and so are cells. Where do we draw the line?

*“The situation is infinitely more comple? than anything we’ve published. The ‘basic set’ of partners is different for every lichen group. Some have more bacteria, some fewer; some have one yeast species, some have two, or none. Interestingly, we have yet to find any lichen that matches the traditional definition of one fungus and one alga.”
What do the new fungal partners actually do in the lichen, I asked.
“We’re not yet sure,” Spribille replied. “Every time we go in and try to find out who’s doing what, we get confounded. Instead of finding out the roles of the players, we bump into yet more players. The deeper we dig, the more we find.”
Spribille’s findings are troubling for some researchers because they suggest that the lichen symbiosis is not as “locked in” as it has been thought to be. “Some people think about symbiosis as being like a package from IKEA,” Spribille e?plained, “with clearly identified parts, and functions, and order in which it’s assembled.” His findings suggest instead that a broad range of different players might be able to form a lichen, and that they ?ust need to “tickle each other in the right way.” It’s less about the identity of the “singers” in the lichen, and more about what they do—the metabolic “song” that each of them sings. In this view, lichens are dynamic syste?s rather than a catalogue of interacting components.*

**Now I get the comparison between lichen and an entire ecosystem. I think that promiscuity of elements in nature is what makes life life. And I think it's something that differentiates it from our current computer architectures. The hardware itself is Turing complete, not just the software. There are two levels of universality.

*Perhaps it isn’t so hard for us to relate to lichens after all. This sort of relationship-building enacts one of the oldest evolutionary ma?ims. If the word cyborg—short for “cybernetic organism”—describes the fusion between a living organism and a piece of technology, then we, like all other life-forms are symborgs, or symbiotic organisms. The authors of a seminal paper on the symbiotic view of life take a clear stance on this point. “There have never been individuals,” they declare. “We are all lichens.”*

**I would like to extend it outwards to our technology as well. It's all just a soup of information having complex interactions. Our technology should be considered life, and each new assimilated tool makes you a new species. It's easier to digest the fact that lifeforms are messy if we consider the messiness of our tools, technology, how we use them and how they use us. When we drive a car we are essentially a car human, same thing with a bike or any other tool. We transform ourselves to different species all the time. Similar to how fungi can choose to be lichen and then stop being it. When we drive a car we make the car part of our body map, we're one with the car. Lichen must have a similar capability, a feeling of unity between its composed parts. Or is it too brain centric?

*However, O?hiocordyce?s is closely related to the ergot fungi, from which the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann originally isolated the compounds used to make LSD, and is able to produce the family of chemicals that LSD derives from—a group known as “ergot alkaloids.” Inside infected ants the parts of the O?hiocordyce?s genome responsible for the production of these alkaloids are activated, suggesting that they might have a role to play in the manipulation of ant behavior.*

**If they're manipulating their behavior through hallucination, then the hallucination have to be indistinguishable from reality and it has to be rather uniform. Perhaps it's not as hard to achieve that for ant consciousness.

*There are many e?amples of into?ication in the animal world—birds eat inebriating berries, lemurs lick millipedes, moths drink the nectar of psychoactive flowers—and it is likely that we have been using mind-altering drugs for longer than we have been human.*

*The researchers were surprised to find that the Ento?o?hthora fungus carries around a type of virus that infects insects, not fungi. The lead author of the study reported it to be “one of the whackiest discoveries” of his time in science. What’s whacky is the implication: that the fungus uses the virus to manipulate the mind of insects. It’s still a hypothesis, but it’s plausible. A number of related viruses speciali?e in modifying insect behavior. One such virus is in?ected by parasitic wasps into ladybirds, which tremble, remain rooted to the spot, and become guardians for the wasp’s eggs. Another similar virus makes honeybees more aggressive. By harnessing a mind-manipulating virus, the fungus wouldn’t have to evolve the ability to modify the mind of its insect host.*

**Yet another example of cross-species collaboration and division of labor. How does it start? They just happen to bump into each other and start improving their survival rates?

*Provided these three conditions are met—traits must be inherited, they must vary, and their variation must affect an organism’s fitness—e?tended characteristics will be sub?ect to natural selection and will evolve in an analogous way to their bodily characteristics. Beavers that make better dams are more likely to survive and pass on the ability to make better dams. But human dams—or any human building for that matter— don’t count as part of our e?tended phenotype because we aren’t born with an instinct to build specific structures that directly affect our fitness.*

**What about technological evolution? A better human made dam will have some sort of benefit and be exposed to some sort of evolutionary pressure, and at the same time technology cannot be explained without involving humans. What's the purpose of limiting the extended phenotype? I suppose to maintain its explanatory powers, but in the end doesn't it give us a better explanation if we recognize how connected everything is?

*The conventional approach was—and remains to a large degree—to use stuff, whether drugs or a surgical tool, to treat the stuff that the body is made out of, ?ust as we might use tools to repair a machine. Drugs are normally understood to work through a pharmacological circuit that bypasses the conscious mind entirely: A drug affects a receptor, which triggers a change in symptoms.
By contrast, psilocybin—like LSD and other psychedelics—appears to act on symptoms of mental illness via the ?ind. The standard circuit is enlarged: A drug affects a receptor, which triggers a change of mind, which triggers a change in symptoms. Patients’ psychedelic e?periences themselves appear to be the cure.*

**It's very easy to get to this conclusion if you think about hardware fixes and software fixes. An experience in the mind changes the software be giving the mind a new data point to use going forward.

*Terence McKenna was a great advocate of this view. ?iven a sufficiently large dose, he asserted, the mushroom could be e?pected to speak, plainly and clearly, talking “elo?uently of itself in the cool night of the mind.”
Fungi have no hands with which to manipulate the world, but with psilocybin as a chemical messenger, they could borrow a human body and use its brain and senses to think and speak through. McKenna thought fungi could wear our minds, occupy our senses, and, most important, impart knowledge about the world out there. Among other things, fungi could use psilocybin to influence humans in an attempt to deflect our destructive habits as a species. For McKenna, this was a symbiotic partnership that presented possibilities “richer and even more baro?ue” than those available to humans or fungi alone.*

**If fungi have the capacity to transmit memories through generations, they could very well have accumulated lots of knowledge and ideas considering how long they've been around.

*For the relationship to thrive, both plant and fungus must make a good metabolic match. It is a familiar pact. In photosynthesis, plants harvest carbon from the atmosphere and forge the energy-rich carbon compounds— sugars and lipids—on which much of the rest of life depends. By growing within plant roots, mycorrhi?al fungi ac?uire privileged access to these sources of energy: They get fed. However, photosynthesis isn’t enough to support life. Plants and fungi need more than a source of energy. Water and minerals must be scavenged from the ground—full of te?tures and micropores, electrically charged cavities, and labyrinthine rotscapes. Fungi are deft rangers in this wilderness and can forage in a way that plants can’t.
By hosting fungi within their roots, plants gain hugely improved access to these sources of nutrients. They, too, get fed. By partnering, plants gain a prosthetic fungus, and fungi gain a prosthetic plant. Both use the other to e?tend their reach.*

**How well do they survive on their own? Who's using who? Are there other conceivable relationships like this between other forms of life and perhaps technology? Reminds me of Levi from Scavengers Reign, a robot who's infected by a plant and gains consciousness.

*The earliest plants were little more than puddles of green tissue, with no roots or other speciali?ed structures. Over time, they evolved coarse fleshy organs to house their fungal associates, who scavenged the soil for nutrients and water. By the time the first roots evolved, the mycorrhi?al association was already some fifty million years old.*

**How much capability is there from the start as opposed to given by accidental mutations? Are the organisms trying out stuff and that's what drives the change in them? Is it a little bit of both?

*Mycorrhi?al fungi are so prolific that their mycelium makes up between a third and a half of the living mass of soils.*

**I doubt they've scoured the whole earth, but they're able to extrapolate from the data they have. Statistics is an insane efficiency boost.

*“The levels of carbon dio?ide in the atmosphere drop off dramatically at the same time as land plants are evolving increasingly comple? structures,” Field e?plained. The surge in plant productivity in turn depended on their mycorrhi?al partners. It’s a predictable se?uence of events. One of the biggest limits to plant growth is a scarcity of the nutrient phosphorus. One of the things that mycorrhi?al fungi do best—one of their most prominent metabolic “songs”—is to mine phosphorus from the soil and transfer it to their plant partners. If plants are fertili?ed with phosphorus, they grow more. The more plants grow, the more they draw down carbon dio?ide from the atmosphere. The more plants live, the more plants die, and the more carbon is buried in soils and sediments. The more carbon that is buried, the less there is in the atmosphere.*

**Plants were in the business of climate change way before humans. It's interesting that the carbon was buried, in a sense even nature hadn't figured out a circular system. Plants were essentially dumping their waste into the ground like we do. With us as custodians we can put that carbon back into circulation and create a healthier system.

*Strawberries aren’t alone in being sensitive to the identity of their fungal partners. Most plants—from a potted snapdragon to a giant se?uoia—will develop differently when grown with different communities of mycorrhi?al fungus. Basil plants, for e?ample, produce different profiles of the aromatic oils that make up their flavor when grown with different mycorrhi?al strains. Some fungi have been found to make tomatoes sweeter than others;
some change the essential oil profile of fennel, coriander, and mint; some increase the concentration of iron and carotenoids in lettuce leaves, the antio?idant activity in artichoke heads, or the concentrations of medicinal compounds in Saint-?ohn’s-wort and echinacea.*

**Is the balance of nutrients being exchanged or are there other chemicals at work?

*In one set of e?periments, she found that plant roots were able to supply carbon preferentially to fungal strains that provided them with more phosphorus. In return, fungi that received more carbon from the plant supplied it with yet more phosphorus. E?change was in some sense negotiated between the two depending on the availability of resources.
Kiers hypothesi?ed that these “reciprocal rewards” have helped to keep plant and fungal associations stable over evolutionary time. Because both partners share control of the e?change, neither partner would be able to hi?ack the relationship for their own e?clusive benefit.*

**A lot of beauty arises from tension. 

---
Page: 141

*One can think of mycorrhi?al relationships as stretched along a continuum, with parasites at one pole and cooperative mutualists at the other. Some plants benefit from their fungal partners under some conditions and not under others. ?row plants with plenty of phosphorus, and they might become less picky about which fungal species they partner with.
?row cooperative fungi alongside other cooperative fungi, and they might become less cooperative. Same fungus, same plant, different setting, different outcome.*

**How much of the same cooperation and parasitism dynamics can we see in human relationships? 

---
Page: 145

*The ability of plants and mycorrhi?al fungi to reshape their relationships has profound implications. We are familiar with the story: Throughout human history, partnerships with other organisms have e?tended the reach of both humans and nonhumans. Human relationships with corn brought about new forms of civili?ation. Relationships with horses allowed new forms of transport. Relationships with yeast permitted new forms of alcohol production and distribution. In each case, humans and their nonhuman partners redefined their possibilities.
Horses and humans remain separate organisms, as do plants and mycorrhi?al fungi, but both are echoes of an ancient tendency for organisms to associate.*

**Without creating synergistic relationships with other lifeforms you lose a relative advantage to the life around you.

Page: 146

*Faced with catastrophic environmental change, much of life depends on the ability of plants and fungi to adapt to new conditions, whether in polluted or deforested landscapes or in newly created environments such as urban green roofs. Increases in atmospheric carbon dio?ide, changes in climate, and pollution all influence the microscopic trading decisions of plant roots and their fungal partners. As has long been the case, the influences of these trading decisions scale up and spill out over whole ecosystems and landmasses.*

**The ecosystem might not be able to support our needs within the time frame we want it to, but falling apart is part of the process. It'll rebuild itself, and it'll include the knowledge of how to deal with carbon sequestering apes.

*Most plants are promiscuous and can engage with many mycorrhi?al partners. Mycorrhi?al fungi, too, are promiscuous in their relationships with plants. Separate fungal networks can fuse with each other. The result? Potentially vast, comple?, and collaborative systems of shared mycorrhi?al networks.*

**What's the bandwidth and range of this network and what kind of stuff flows through it? 

---
Page: 156

*As Read wrote in his commentary in Nature, the possibility that resources could pass between plants suggested “that we should place less emphasis on competition between plants, and more on the distribution of resources within the community.”*

**If we take ourselves as a reflection of nature, it should be obvious that cooperation plays just as big of a role as rivalry, if not bigger.

*Monotro?a and Voyria aren’t alone in living this way. About ten percent of plant species share the habit. Like lichens and mycorrhi?al relationships, mycoheterotrophy is an evolutionary refrain and has arisen independently in at least forty-si? separate plant lineages. Some mycohets, like Monotro?a and Voyria, never photosynthesi?e. Others behave like mycohets when they’re young but become donors when they get older and start to photosynthesi?e, an approach that Katie Field calls “take now, pay later.”
As Read pointed out to me, all twenty-five thousand species of orchid —“the largest and arguably the most successful plant family on the surface of the Earth”—are mycohets at some stage in their development, whether they take now and pay later, or take now and continue to take later.*

**Evolution has spacefilling qualities to it. Just like any other complex network. If there's a niche for it, nature will fill it.

*Resources passed from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity.
These behaviors present a pu??le. At its most basic, the problem is this:
Why would plants give resources to a fungus that goes on to give them to a neighboring plant—a potential competitor? At first glance it looks like altruism. Evolutionary theory doesn’t cope well with altruism because altruistic behavior benefits the receiver at the cost of the donor. If a plant donor assists a competitor at a cost to itself, its genes are less likely to make it into the ne?t generation. If the altruist’s genes don’t make it into the ne?t generation, the altruistic behavior will soon be weeded out.
There are a number of ways around this impasse. One relies on the idea that the costs to donor plants aren’t actually costs. Many plants have plenty of access to light. For such plants, carbon is not a limited resource. If a plant’s surplus carbon passes into a mycorrhi?al network where it is en?oyed by many as a “public good,” the charge of altruism can be avoided because no one—whether donor or receiver—has incurred a cost. Another possibility is that both sender and receiver plants benefit, but at different times. An orchid might “take now,” but if it “pays later,” then no one has incurred a cost overall. A birch may benefit when it receives carbon from a fir in the spring, but the fir will surely benefit from the carbon it receives from the birch during the high summer, when it finds itself in the shaded understory.
There are other considerations. In evolutionary terms, it might be beneficial for a plant to assist a close relative to pass on its genes even at a cost to itself—a phenomenon known as “kin selection.” Some studies have investigated this possibility by comparing the amount of carbon that passes between pairs of Douglas fir seedlings that are siblings and pairs of seedlings that are unrelated. As one would e?pect, carbon moved downhill, from a larger donor plant to a smaller receiver plant. But in some cases, more carbon passed between siblings than between strangers: Siblings appeared to share more fungal connections than did strangers, providing more pathways for carbon to move between them.*

**Reciprocity and kin selection should account for altruistic behavior. The group of organisms that solve the prisoners dilemma survive for longer than those who don't.

Page: 164

*A mycorrhi?al fungus that can keep its various plants alive is at an advantage: a diverse portfolio of plant partners insures it against the death of one of them. If a fungus depends on several orchids, and one of them won’t be able to supply it with carbon until it grows larger, the fungus will benefit by supporting the young orchid while it grows—to let it “take now,” provided it will “pay later.” Adopting a myco-centric perspective helps to avoid the problem of altruism. It also positions fungi front and center:
brokers of entanglement able to mediate the interactions between plants according to their own fungal needs.*

**They are more similar to a blockchain network than the internet. Though I have to say, in terms of benefitting the commons the internet is superior. It's embodying the heart of open-source, whereas blockchain is much more extractive and commercial.

*In fact, fungi are far from being passive cables. As we’ve seen, mycelial networks can solve comple? spatial problems and have evolved a finely tuned ability to transport substances around themselves. Although material tends to move through fungal networks downhill, from source to sink, transport rarely occurs by passive diffusion alone: It is far too slow. The rivers of cellular fluid that flow within fungal hyphae allow rapid transport, and although these flows are ultimately governed by source–sink dynamics, fungi can direct the flow by growing, thickening, and pruning back parts of the network—or indeed, fusing with another network entirely. Without the ability to regulate flow within their networks, much of fungal life— including the intricately choreographed growth of mushrooms—would be impossible.*

**They are the miners of the network, and the plants are the nodes of the network. 

---
Page: 166

*Shared mycorrhi?al networks can have yet more ambiguous conse?uences. A number of plant species produce chemicals that stunt or kill plants growing nearby. Under normal conditions, the passage of these chemicals through the soil is slow, and they don’t always reach to?ic concentrations. Mycorrhi?al networks can help to overcome these limitations, in some cases providing a “fungal fast lane” or “superhighway” for plants that broadcast poisonous deterrents. In one e?periment, a to?ic compound released from the fallen leaves of walnut trees was able to travel through mycorrhi?al networks and accumulate around the roots of tomato plants, reducing their growth.
Wood wide webs, in other words, are about far more than the movement of resources—whether energy-rich carbon compounds, nutrients, or water.
Besides poisons, hormones that regulate plant growth and development can pass through shared mycorrhi?al networks. In many species of fungus, DNA-containing nuclei and other genetic elements such as viruses or RNA are free to travel through the mycelium, suggesting that genetic material might pass between plants via a fungal channel—although these possibilities have barely been e?plored.*

**Spacefilling is like finding every possible exploit and unregulating the ones that over time prove to be effective. 

---
Page: 169

*How best to interpret the behavior of shared mycorrhi?al networks is a sensitive sub?ect. Some researchers are concerned about how wood wide webs are commonly portrayed. “?ust because we found that plants can respond to a neighbor,” ?ohnson told me, “doesn’t mean that there is some altruistic network in operation.” The idea that plants are talking to each other and warning each other of imminent attack is an anthropomorphic delusion. “It’s very attractive to think that way,” he admitted, but it’s ultimately “a load of nonsense.”*

**Our tendency to anthropomorphize is one of the greatest limiters to our imagination. When we get rid of it we can more easily create novelty in our minds. 

---
Page: 172

*There are no fundamental laws in operation here. Scale-free properties tend to emerge in any network that grows. “Most networks that arise in the world are the result of some kind of growth process,” Barabási e?plained.
There are more ways for a new node to connect to a well-connected node than to a less well-connected node. Old nodes with lots of links thus end up with even more links. As Beiler put it, “You can see these mycorrhi?al networks as a contagious process. You have some founding trees and the network grows from there. Trees with more links to other trees tend to accumulate more links, more ?uickly.”*

**Network theory is very deep in the stack of reality.

Page: 174

*Entities that behave in these ways are loosely termed “comple? adaptive systems”: comple?, because their behavior is difficult to predict from a knowledge of their constituent parts alone; adaptive, because they self-organi?e into new forms or behaviors in response to their circumstances.
You—like all organisms—are a comple? adaptive system. So is the World Wide Web. So are brains, termite colonies, swarming bees, cities, and financial markets—to name a few. Within comple? adaptive systems, small changes can bring about large effects that can only be observed in the system as a whole. Rarely can a neat arrow be plotted between cause and effect. Stimuli—which may be unremarkable gestures in themselves—swirl into often surprising responses. Financial crashes are a good e?ample of this type of dynamic nonlinear process. So are snee?es, and orgasms.*

**Geoffrey West has taken the greatest stab at defining the physics of complex adaptive systems in his book Scale.

*Are we able to release ourselves from these metaphors, think outside the skull, and learn to talk about wood wide webs without leaning on one of our well-worn human totems? Are we able to let shared mycorrhi?al networks be ?uestions, rather than answers known in advance? “I try ?ust to look at the system and let the lichen be a lichen.” Discussions of wood wide webs often lead me back to the words of Toby Spribille, the researcher who keeps discovering new partners in the lichen symbiosis. Wood wide webs aren’t lichens—although to think of them as enormous lichens that we can walk around in brings welcome variety to the range of metaphors currently on offer. Nonetheless, I wonder if we can learn something from Spribille’s patience. Are we able to stand back, look at the system, and let the polyphonic swarms of plants and fungi and bacteria that make up our homes and our worlds be themselves, and ?uite unlike anything else? What would that do to our minds?*

**To counter or normal way of thinking it's helpful to playfully come up with perspectives that are wholly different from our own. Imagine that the world was a nucleus and our solar system a cell, what interesting analogies could you dig out from that perspective? It doesn't have to be correct, it just has to provide a different viewpoint.
