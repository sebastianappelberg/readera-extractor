*But I expect that readers will bring along their own ?rst principles regardless, and will ?nd the counsels of the Stoics compatible with a wide range of them.*

**It might be obvious but what popped out here to me is that first principles is based in the person's metaphysical view of reality. You start from the very baseline assumptions. 

---
Page: 25

*e Stoics infer from all this that our way of reacting to anything depends, indeed, on thoughts we think and beliefs we hold, however deeply buried they might be. Since those beliefs and thoughts belong to us, they should be possible to change, and so ought to be subject to more rational scrutiny than they usually get. Our experience of the world is our own doing, not the world’s doing, and the Stoic means to take responsibility for it.*

**In a certain sense you are the interplay between yourself and your environment. So you can change yourself by changing the environment. I know that in some circumstances I'm a decent person and in others, like when I'm under severe stress, I'm not. I'm not sure if you can get rid of the effects of that interplay, nor if it's desirable. Maybe the stoics would count the part of the environment that you can control as a part of yourself?

---
Page: 26

*In sum, it is against Stoic policy to worry about things that you can’t control. What we can control, and should care about, are our own judgments and actions.*

**You can control situations by moving yourself in or out of them.

---
Page: 28

*In short, we vex ourselves with beliefs, mostly half-conscious, that came from nowhere we can name and that tend to make us unhappy and ridiculous. inking better and harder about the workings of our minds can free us from many subtle insanities.*

**Its the half conscious part that gets to me. I don't want to be controlled by stupidity and lack of clarity. I want every aspect of myself, not be perfectly virtuous, but perfectly out in the open without anything that's hiding behind some stupid corner. 

---
Page: 28

*Stoics take a dif f erent view of adversity than is conventional. ey don’t seek out pain or hardship, but they seek a mindset that isn’t thrown into disarray by those things and that is able to turn them to good. It is an unavoidable and important part of life to meet with what we don’t want; and unwanted developments produce great achievements, strong characters, and other things we do want.*

**Are there hardships that are just plain negative? Or is there always good in them? Are there hardships that are more valuable than others?

*e philosophy can be considered an ef f ort to help us toward the state of mind we might reach on our own with more time, rather than as an ef f ort to make us less human. Looking at Stoicism this way also makes clear that the practicing Stoic isn’t unfeeling or uncaring. e Stoic responds to the suf f ering of others like a good doctor who has seen it all before: with activity and compassion, though probably without much emotion.*

**It's like the opposite of beginner's mind. 

---
Page: 33

*e ?rst principle of practical Stoicism is this: we don’t react to events; we react to our judgments about them, and the judgments are up to us. We will see the Stoics develop that idea in the pages to come, but this expression of it is typical:
If any external thing causes you distress, it is not the thing itself that troubles you, but your own judgment about it. And this you have the power to eliminate now.*

**What about stress responses? They circumvent the rationale parts of the brain. There's zero judgements there. That's why you need to immediately ground yourself when struck by fear and then you can go on to control. 

---
Page: 34

*It tells us that we respond to externals – to things out there, not to the mind itself. It has to learn to see and describe its own role more accurately. Stoicism means to help us think better about our thinking, to teach the mind to understand the mind, to make the ?sh more aware of the water.*

**Beware of the internal environment of your mind. 

---
Page: 35

*More broadly, the Stoics didn’t distinguish in their thinking as we now might between all the forms that our judgments can take – conscious opinions, unconscious attitudes, conditioned responses, chemical predispositions, genetic tendencies, and so on – and how some of those can be changed more easily than others. ey do make a few such acknowledgments. e Stoics say that some reactions have a physical basis we can’t control. (See Chapter 9, Section 1.) And Seneca concedes that we are born with some temperamental features that can’t be changed. (See Chapter 10, Section 10.) But our ordinary reactions to things – our reactions at rest – are viewed mostly just as ours to control with practice. Anyone can see how dif f i cult this idea would be to carry out in full; just think of your own strongest likes and dislikes, and how hard it would be to reverse them with any amount of thinking. But fortunately, and importantly, Stoicism doesn’t care what our tastes are, and doesn’t call for reversal of our aversions and desires. It calls for detachment from them. at isn’t easy, either, but it is far more oen feasible.*

**Recognizing that there are different types of judgements and that some of them are even physiological makes it more legit.

---
Page: 36

*For reactions that more stubbornly seem to be inevitable, though, the Stoics oen use comparisons to make their point. ey look at the dif f erent ways that people react to the same events in dif f erent circumstances, times, and places. What some people fear (and can’t imagine not fearing), others don’t; what some are ready to die for, to others is nothing. e pain or grief that seems a brute fact to us is experienced very dif f erently in other conditions and cultures. Evidently our reactions aren’t inevitable aer all. ey somehow must be our doing, and depend on judgments that we hold and thus might be able to change.*

**I like the socratic nature of this line of inquiry. Using an everyday example to highlight the point. 

---
Page: 39

*It is more normal to take for granted whatever ideas and opinions pass through our minds, living them out with no more scrutiny than we give to the air we breathe. Stoics try to get enough separation from those mental events to control them – to notice the irrationality that drives much of what we say to ourselves and to replace it with something wiser. Sometimes this is indeed easier said than done, or even impossible. But sometimes, to the contrary, it is easier than it sounds. You stop saying one thing to yourself and say another instead.*

**Sounds a lot like mindfulness. Just let your thoughts be there, like any other sensation and don't get attached. But what do you do about the primal responses? 

---
Page: 40

*ere is some risk that these passages, taken in isolation, could seem to encourage a kind of vacuity. e goal of the Stoic, though, is not to empty the mind, but to clear it of foolishness and misjudgment. Learning to identify foolishness and misjudgment will be the work of the chapters to come. In the meantime, we may recall that neither of the authors just shown was seeking a placid or retiring existence, or a mind free from complexity.
Each of them, in their times, was among the most powerful people on earth.*

**Cleaning impurities, not virtues. We should still aim to live a good life. 

---
Page: 42

*e mere fact that men endure the same pain more easily when they voluntarily undergo it for the sake of their country than when they suf f er it for some lesser cause, shows that the intensity of the pain depends on the state of mind of the suf f erer, not on its own intrinsic nature.*

**This puts to words why I believe that I'd have no problem facing tough situations if I did something I believed in.

---
Page: 45

*Once we take in a custom or habit, the judgments they produce feel as though they are strictly our own, not anything that was implanted and could be dif f erent. e spell of familiarity must be broken, and this is best done by looking at the great range of responses to the same things that have come to seem natural to people in dif f erent conditions.*

**Experiencing many different perspectives is important for us to break out of our own boxes.

---
Page: 47

*Our hunger or thirst presents itself as a sensation of the body, not as something in the mind that we might be able to change with our thinking.
But the Stoic would challenge those impressions.
First, our appetites oen are up to us – in advance. We may have trouble changing them once they exist, but we have a lot to say about whether and how they arise in the ?rst place. Stoics become more aware not just of how our appetites af f ect our experience, but of how our choices af f ect our appetites. We allow ourselves to get hungry, or not; we tantalize ourselves with comparisons and other thoughts that stir desire, or we don’t. e management of appetites – when and how to cultivate them, when and how not – is part of Stoic practice. (Cultivation is called for in cases like the one Seneca describes above, as when learning how to take satisfaction from simple and natural pleasures.) All this is an example of the reorientation the Stoics recommend in general: spending less energy on getting or avoiding things, and more on knowing why we want them (or don’t) and how the way we think might af f ect this.*

**This jives with the my thoughts about changing your environment to change yourself. We think about how everything in the world affects our judgements, we think about the judgements that are good and bad, we make choices so our judgments pull us in the desired direction. 

---
Page: 50

*Like a bowl of water, so is the soul; like the light falling on the water, so are the impressions the soul receives. When the water is disturbed, the light also seems to be disturbed; yet it is not disturbed.*

**The sources of our impressions are almost always neutral. Our judgements distort them. 

---
Page: 52

*Pay attention to your impressions, watch over them without sleeping, for what you guard is no small thing: self-respect and ?delity and self-possession, a mind free from emotion, pain, fear, disturbance – in a word, freedom.*

**How does one be mindful without effort? Staying hypervigilant will drain you and make you worse off. 

---
Page: 56

*we are af f ected by our judgments about events, not by events themselves. We therefore have more control than we think over what we experience. is chapter is the other side of the coin. We attach ourselves to externals that we imagine we can control but really can’t, and deceive ourselves about them routinely – habits that make us unhappy and unfree.
So in ef f ect these ?rst chapters suggest a reversal. We waste our energy on things that aren’t up to us, and are barely conscious of the things that are up to us. Stoicism is the ef f ort to turn that around and to move one’s center of gravity to a more useful location.*

**It is in some sense to be in perfect harmony with the universe. Our whole soul is like a very high dimensional puzzle piece and there's a spot where it fits right in. Although I suppose that's besides the point. We have control over our reactions to events, we don't have control over events themselves and thinking we have that will cause misalignment.

*When you see someone groveling before another man, or ?attering him contrary to his own opinion, you can con?dently say he is not free. And not only if he does this for a mere dinner, but also if it is for the sake of a prefecture or consulship. People who do these things for petty ends you can call petty slaves, while those who do them for grand purposes can be called mega slaves, as they deserve.*

**Lying to yourself for anyone or anything else means that you're not free. 

---
Page: 64

*We have trouble resisting externals because they seem appealing or frightening or otherwise impressive; but they seem that way because we haven’t learned to see them as they are. Seneca thought it worthwhile to look at our reactions the way we do at the reactions of children.*

**Only a child would be afraid to be scorned. Only a child would be afraid of anything. 

---
Page: 65

*So remember this above all, to strip away the disorder of things and to see what is in each of them: you will learn that nothing in them is frightening but the fear itself. What you see happening to boys, happens to us too (slightly bigger boys). eir friends – the ones they are accustomed to and play with – if they see them wearing masks, they are terri?ed. e mask needs to be removed not just from people but from things, and the true appearance of each restored.*

**The fear is more frightening than reality. 

---
Page: 66

*“His ship is lost.” What has happened? His ship is lost. “He has been led of f to prison.” What has happened? He has been led of f to prison.
e notion that he fares badly, each man adds on his own.*

**Don't add your own judgements or opinion to situations. See it for what it truly is. Ask questions out of pure curiosity and even as you learn more, refrain from imbueing it with feelings and judgements. 

---
Page: 67

*Impressions like these are the ones that penetrate to the heart of things themselves and let us see what they really are. We should do the same in all areas of life, and, whenever things appear too highly valued, we should lay them bare in our minds, perceive their cheapness, and strip of f the prestige they have traditionally been assigned.*

**Not only should we not add untruths to things out there, we should remove untruths that were already there. The more we do this, the more we will start to appreciate what's really important. 

---
Page: 68

*Just as the eyesight can be sharpened and cleared up by certain drugs, if we are willing to free our spiritual vision from impediments, we will be able to perceive virtue even when it is hidden within the body, even with poverty as an obstacle, even where insigni?cance and disgrace stand in the way. We shall see that beauty, I say, however much it may be covered in ?lth. Conversely, we will be able to perceive evil, and the sluggishness of a wretched mind, however much the view may be blocked by gleaming riches, or however strongly a false light – here of rank and position, there of great power – beats down on the beholder.*

**To be able to do this is to know the worthy from the unworthy. 

---
Page: 70

*But why do I speak of others? If you want to take your own measure, put aside your money, your estates, your honors, and look inside yourself. At present you are taking the word of others for what you are.*

**Everything should be under the scrutiny of clear vision, not only external things but other people and yourself. Everything in the world. 

---
Page: 71

*It is dif f i cult to combine and bring together those things – the carefulness of one devoted to material things, and the steadiness of one who is indif f erent to them – but it is not impossible; otherwise happiness would be impossible. It is like planning a sea voyage. What can I do? I can choose the captain, the sailors, the day, the right moment. en a storm comes upon us. At this point, what concern is it of mine? My part is done. e problem belongs to another – the captain.*

**This is a food piece on letting go and trusting others, decentralization. 

---
Page: 71

*e game pieces are neither good nor bad, nor are the dice. How can I know what the next throw of the dice will be? But to use the throw carefully and skillfully, this belongs to me. In life, too, then, the principal task is this: to distinguish and separate things, and say: “Externals are outside my power: my choices are within my power. Where shall I seek the good and the bad? Within, in the things that are my own.” But in what depends on others, call nothing either good or bad, bene?t or harm, or anything else of the kind. “What then? Does this mean we shouldn’t care how we use them?” By no means. at would be a wrongful use of our faculty of choice, and so contrary to nature.
External things should be used with care, because their use can be good or bad. But at the same time you should keep your composure and your calm, because the things themselves are neither good nor bad.*

**Play the cards that your dealt. Don't just lie down and do nothing. 

---
Page: 72

*If we placed our happiness in winning the stake, we placed it in what depended upon causes beyond our power, and out of our direction. We necessarily exposed ourselves to perpetual fear and uneasiness, and frequently to grievous and mortifying disappointments. If we placed it in playing well, in playing fairly, in playing wisely and skillfully; in the propriety of our own conduct in short; we placed it in what, by proper discipline, education, and attention, might be altogether in our own power, and under our own direction. Our happiness was perfectly secure, and beyond the reach of fortune.*

**Don't seek to win, seek to become better as a player of life.

Page: 74

*To ourselves we seem exceedingly important, and the time and place where we live feels signi?cant. e Stoic regards those impressions as mistakes. ey arise because our ordinary perspective on the world, the one we use by default, is misleading. We look out from inside and see things in terms of ourselves; we are forgetful or unconscious of how puny and brief our allotments are. e Stoics rectify this by pointing out the facts about the scale of our existence and our mortality.*

**Seeing things from different perspectives is important to learning something deeply and emotionally. You don't really understand another person until you're able to put yourself in their shoes, see the world how they see it. The same is true for seeing the cosmos for what it is, until you try to see it from smaller and grander perspectives, you're worldview remains egocentric. 

---
Page: 76

*Asia and Europe are corners of the universe; the whole of the sea is a drop in the universe; Athos, a tiny clod of dirt in the universe; all the present time is one point in eternity. Everything is small, easily changing, disappearing.*

**I sense a discrete view of the universe. We are the thinnest of slices, accumulating forever. 

---
Page: 77

*Consider that as the heaps of sand piled on one another hide the former sands, so in life the events which go before are soon covered by those which come aer.*

**This is the opposite of the gladiator quote: "what we do in life echoes in eternity". Though, the sand metaphor could be construed as to mean that what's coming next will be built on what was before but it'll also cover it.

---
Page: 78

*Soon the earth will cover us all. en the earth itself will be changed;
and whatever comes next will continue to be changed endlessly; then those things again, to in?nity. Someone who contemplates these successive waves of change and alteration, and their speed, will look down upon all mortal things.*

**Trying to get an intuitive feeling for this makes your mind expand infinitely, it's destabilizing almost.

---
Page: 79

*But this one thing I know: all works of mortals are doomed to mortality. We live in the midst of things destined to die.*

**There's nothing that we create that's immortal. They struggled with this in Death's End too. Even rock inscriptions only last for 500 million years, then it'll be gone. 

---
Page: 82

*Aristotle tells us of little creatures on the river Hypanis that live for only a day. One that dies at eight in the morning dies young; one that dies at ?ve in the evening dies of old age. Who would not laugh to see the dif f erence between such momentary lifespans counted as happiness or unhappiness? Yet calling our own lives long or short, when they are compared with eternity, or even to the spans of mountains, rivers, stars, trees, and certain other animals, seems no less absurd.*

**Our lifespan would be a joke to a star. A star is a baby compared to the cosmos. One of the longest existing structures in the universe is life itself. 

---
Page: 84

*Carefully consider the past – the countless changes of political regimes. You can also see future events in advance; they will be of entirely the same kind, for it is impossible to depart from the pattern of what is happening now. It follows that to have observed human life for forty years is the same as for ten thousand. For what more are you going to see?*

**Most of the things we see is the just the endless cycle of what has been going on forever. Journeys, love, children, learning, discovering, etc.

---
Page: 86

*Realize that being remembered has no value, nor does your reputation, nor anything else at all.*

**What does it do for you to be remembered or not remembered by a person you don't know living a million years from now?

---
Page: 87

*We believe these af f airs of ours are great because we are small.*

**An ant is small because we're not a bacteria. A tree has a long life because we're not a mountain. 

---
Page: 91

*Freedom from the fear of death is regarded by the Stoic as one of the central goals of philosophical work, from which many other liberties and goods follow. One who regards death without fear steps more lightly through life, and is free from many other fears as well; for death is the master fear that lies behind them.*

**If you're going to work on becoming more courageous, why not start with seriously facing the fear of death? 

---
Page: 91

*He who has learned to die has unlearned slavery. He is above any power, and certainly beyond it. What terrors have prisons and bonds and bars for him?*

**Was this what they were doing in the Elusinian rituals?

---
Page: 93

*To fear death, gentlemen, is nothing else than to think one is wise when one is not; for it is thinking one knows what one does not know. For no one knows whether death be not even the greatest of all blessings to man, but they fear it as if they knew that it is the greatest of evils.*

**How do we deal with something that we know is unknowable? We can't control it, we can't do anything about it. We do know some things about death, we know that we can't talk to people that are dead, that they're not going to be able to continue whatever it is they did in life. 

---
Page: 96

*“What?” I say to myself; “does death so oen test me? Let it do so; I myself have for a long time tested death.” “When?” you ask. Before I was born…. Unless I am mistaken, my dear Lucilius, we go astray in thinking that death follows, when it has both preceded and will follow. Whatever condition existed before our birth, was death. For what does it matter whether you do not begin at all, or whether you end, when the result in either case is non-existence?*

**It's the effect you have on other people that makes it matter. 

---
Page: 95

*at which has died does not fall out of the universe. If it stays here, it also changes here, and is dissolved into its proper parts, which are elements of the universe and of your self. And these change, too, and they do not complain.*

**What we've borrowed from the universe we will give back at the end. 

---
Page: 98

*e same ills befall another, and either because he does not see that they have happened or because he would make a display of pride, he is ?rm and remains unharmed. It is a shame, then, that ignorance and the desire to impress should be stronger than wisdom.*

**Ignorance is bliss, why should not wisdom be the same?

---
Page: 101

*Why fear your last day? It does no more to advance you toward death than any other day did. e last step does not cause your fatigue; it reveals your fatigue. Every day is a step toward death. e last one arrives there.*

**When we finally die it's something that we've working towards all our life. 

---
Page: 102

*e most voluntary death is the ?nest. Our life depends on the will of others; our death depends on our own. In nothing should we defer to our own feelings as much as in this. What others think has nothing to do with this business; it is madness to even consider it.
Living is slavery if the freedom to die is lacking.*

**That's why assisted death should be legal.

---
Page: 102

*Here are the words of the law on this subject: If chance delivers some great misfortune that you cannot remedy, a haven is always nearby.
You can swim away from your body as you would from a leaking boat. Only fools are attached to their bodies by a fear of death rather than a love of life.*

**They've been very easy to open Death's door just because things are tough. But what they really seem to want is to embrace death, not fear it, and inspire that you should build up reasons for loving life.

---
Page: 104

*You ask what the ?nest life span would be? To live until you reach wisdom. e one who gets there has arrived, not at the farthest goal, but at the most important. at man, indeed, may boldly congratulate himself, and give thanks to the gods – and to himself along with them – and count in his reckoning with the universe the fact that he has lived. His account will be in credit: he has given it back a better life than he received.*

**It's an argument against the hedonic treadmill. 

---
Page: 108

*Toward death, at dif f erent paces, moves the entire crowd that now squabbles in the forum, that looks on at the theaters, that prays in the temples; both those you love and revere and those you despise, one heap of ashes will make equal.*

**We're all equal before death. 

---
Page: 109

*Stoics observe that the possibility of death is nearer than we usually imagine, a point of f ered not to cause anxiety but to dispel it; rather than a frightening thing that advances on us, death is next to us all the time. It is best accepted as a reason to live well in the time that remains.*

**The possibility of death should cause us to appreciate all time before it. 

---
Page: 110

*I say that there is no lasting peace for anything that can perish and cause to perish. But I place this fact in the category of solace, actually a very powerful solace, since fear without remedy is what foolish men have…. If you wish to fear nothing, consider that everything is to be feared.*

**Radical acceptance of the reality of fears. 

---
Page: 111

*No one can have a peaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it, or who believes that living through many consulships is a great blessing. Rehearse this thought every day, so that you may be able to peacefully give up this life to which so many clutch and cling, just as those snatched away by a rushing stream clutch and cling to briars and sharp rocks.*

**It has sounded a little bit like they fetishize death and that one should almost desire it. I'm starting to get it now though, they want to embrace it and love it because that's the most pragmatic attitude you can have towards it. Imagine the opposite, you'd be in a position of no appreciation and total fear of what you have no control over.

---
Page: 111

*Let death and exile and every other thing that appears dreadful be every day before your eyes, but most of all death; and you will never harbor any low thoughts, nor have an extravagant desire for anything.*

**When you honestly consider death, you cut out all the bullshit because you're forced to be your best self now because it might be too late at any moment. 

---
Page: 113

*Let us order our minds as if we had come to the end. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life’s account every day.*

**In this way, you force yourself to cleanup all the important things. Not until that is done can you die peacefully. 

---
Page: 114

*e Stoics’ notion that “everything is opinion” becomes, for them, a warrant to examine our usual thinking more closely, department by department, to see whether it squares with reason and with what we know of human nature.*

**How do we know if we can trust our knowledge about human nature?

---
Page: 114

*that we most desire what we do not or cannot have; that the pursuit of a thing is more pleasing than the possession of it; that possession of a good and familiarity with it tend to produce indif f erence or disgust; that we mismeasure the value of what we have, or don’t have, by comparing it to our expectations or to the holdings of others.*

**It's the dopaminergic side of ourselves. The serotonergic side is the one that's content with what it has.

---
Page: 119

*e measure of what is necessary is what is useful. But what standard can limit the super?uous? It is for this reason that men sink themselves in pleasures, and then cannot do without them when once they have become accustomed to them; and it is for this reason they are most wretched – that they have reached such a pass that what was once super?uous to them has become indispensable.*

**The more we have, the more we can't be without. We become weighed down by the need to maintain more, we lose freedom.

---
Page: 119

*Every want that springs, not from any need, but from vice, is of a like character; however much you pile up for it will serve not to end but to advance desire. He who keeps himself within natural limits will not feel poverty; he who exceeds them will be pursued by poverty even amid the greatest wealth.*

**This unfillable desire may drive some people to do great things. Even though they themselves might not be happy, maybe it's better for the world?

---
Page: 120

*Another deception identi?ed by the Stoics: when we work toward a goal, we imagine the happiness that its attainment will bring;
but the pursuit itself turns out to be more enjoyable than the capture of the thing pursued.*

**Is this not a driver then to seek more journeys?

---
Page: 121

*You regard the objects you seek as loy because you lie far away from them. To him who has reached them, they are small and mean. And I am very much mistaken if he does not desire to climb still higher;
that which you regard as the top is merely a rung on the ladder. Now everyone suf f ers from ignorance of the truth; deceived by what they hear others say, they seek these ends as if they were good, and then, aer having won their wish, and suf f ered much, they ?nd them evil, or empty, or less important than they had expected.*

**You're higher up on that ladder though. Having ambitions to climb is not necessarily bad, counting on it to make you happy is. 

---
Page: 125

*Our topic in this section might be considered an aspect of what psychologists today sometimes call adaptation – the tendency to become used to things, and to stop noticing them, and all that follows from this.
Stoics are keen students of adaptation and its workings, some of which help us and some of which make us worse of f . Adaptation was relevant to Chapter 1, for example, because getting accustomed to a condition can cause us to regard it as natural and inevitable when it isn’t. Adaptation will be relevant again when we take up the subject of adversity, because adaptation helps with its management. Adaptation also is at the root of many desires, because it corrodes our ability to ?nd pleasure in whatever we already have and so drives us on to new wants. Smith nicely tied the phenomenon to a larger Stoic claim.*

**It's impressive how much understanding can be gained from deep introspection. They were basically masters of viewing things from a first-person perspective. And they were very pragmatic with what they found. I bet you could uncover a lot of what they did by being equally mindful.

---
Page: 126

*at man will never be happy whom the sight of a happier man will torment.*

**Envy can be subtle and hard to detect. Often times your mind rationalize why you should dislike someone before your sensible mind has had time to assess the situation.

---
Page: 127

*Envy doesn’t just make us less satis?ed; it makes us desire things that we otherwise wouldn’t want at all.*

**It's especially dangerous when envy makes us work towards the wrong thing. We should be happy for others and be deeply mindful about who we are and what we should be doing ourselves. 

---
Page: 128

*Such is the state of every age, every sex, and every condition: all have their cares, either from nature or from folly: and whoever therefore ?nds himself inclined to envy another, should remember that he knows not the real condition which he desires to obtain, but is certain that by indulging a vicious passion, he must lessen that happiness which he thinks already too sparingly bestowed.*

**You don't have what you envy, so you have no clue what you're actually desiring. Although in some cases you may envy someone for having gained what you lost.

*Wouldn’t anyone admit how much better it is, instead of working hard to get possession of someone else’s wife, to work hard to restrain your desires; instead of being distressed about money, to train yourself to want little; instead of working to become famous, to work not to thirst for fame; instead of ?nding a way to hurt someone you envy, to ?nd a way not to envy anyone; and instead of acting as a slave to false friends, as sycophants do, to suf f er hardships in order to ?nd true friends?*

**Be mindful of your misjudgements and detach yourself from them. Eventually your body will learn not to misjudge those things.

*e Stoics criticize comparisons that cause discontent, as we have seen. But they recommend comparisons that have the opposite ef f ect. One might suppose that all comparisons to others ought to be held strictly irrelevant – that to reduce unhappiness by looking at others who are unhappier makes no more sense than reducing happiness by looking at others who are happier still. But this is another instance of pragmatism in the late Stoics, especially Seneca. ey judge a perspective by its consequences. A comparison may be recommended just because it helps free us from tendencies of the mind that have already been diagnosed as unwanted.*

**It's a way of speeding up the emotional understanding of why an opinion is harmful. Though in some sense instead of envying people who are ahead of you, why don't you just take happiness in their happiness? Good for them.

*If we were all to bring our misfortunes into a common store, so that each person should receive an equal share in the distribution, the majority would be glad to take up their own and depart.*

**Looking at other people's problems adds an extra layer of fear in the form of the unknown. You know your own troubles but not necessarily those of others.

*We should sometimes try to look upon our possessions in the light in which they would appear if we had lost them.*

**I think the word 'sometimes' is important here because we shouldn't attach ourselves too much to what we have either. We should maximally appreciate it but be fully detached from it.

*the pleasures that Stoics do embrace – the kind they regard as natural, and that we experience when we satisfy the appetites we are born with. Seneca considers recreation and games to be among these (and he recognizes a place for drinking as well).
Above all, though, the Stoic is attracted to the pleasures of the mind. Stoics regard wisdom and understanding as producing a kind of joy that is immune from interruption by circumstance.*

**The defining trait for natural pleasures is that they have no downside. Helping someone else in need is an example of something that's purely good.

*at very thing which occupies so many magistrates and so many judges, which makes both magistrates and judges – money! – since it began to be regarded with honor, has caused true honor to fall into ruin. Becoming alternately merchants and merchandise by turns, we ask not what a thing truly is, but what it costs.*

**Focus on the things you think money would help you with. Improve those instead of thinking money will solve it for you. What will you solve by having money and why is that important to you?

*One person seeks joy in feasting and self-indulgence; another, in elections and crowds of supporters; another, in his mistress; another, in the idle display of culture and in literature that has no power to heal. All of them are led astray by delights that are deceptive and short-lived – like drunkenness, for example, which pays for a single hour of hilarious madness with a long-lasting sickness; or like applause and enthusiastic popularity and approval that are gained, and atoned for, at the cost of great mental disquietude.*

**All those pleasure are poor in nutrients. They are like the hypernormal stimuli you get from social media, leaving you hungrier after having consumed them.

*No one who is good and honorable would regret having passed a pleasure by.*

**That's a good definition for an unnatural pleasure. If you would feel better about yourself for not having done it, then it's an unnatural pleasure.

*It is not one who has little, but one who craves more, who is poor.
What does it matter how much you have laid up in your safe or in your warehouse, how large are your ?ocks or your investments, if you covet your neighbor’s property, and if you count not what you have but what remains for you to have?*

**The feeling of having all that you need is subjective, it's an opinion that we have good control over.

Page: 144

*Stoics view wealth not as an absolute state but as a favorable relationship between what one has and what one wants. Most people devote themselves to enlarging the ?rst when they would do better to reduce the second. is is the classic Stoic inversion.*

**Consider for every form that creates dissatisfaction in you whether the stoic inversion is available to you. We have varying degrees of control over different kinds of opinions.

*When we are invited to a banquet, we take what is put before us. If someone should order the host to serve him ?sh or pastries, he would seem eccentric. But out in the world, we ask the gods for things they do not give us – even though there are many things they have given us.*

**So much opportunity is in the hands of the world, be grateful for what you get. In fact enjoy it to the fullest, because at this moment it's the best you can do. Though I wouldn't exclude looking at it dispassionately to see what can be improved for next time. Feedback is so important for progress. Sometimes it feels like the stoics are forgetting about the infinite games.

*One path to acceptance is to imagine the position in which we hope to be le once a desire is ful?lled, and to ask whether the wished-for state might be attained more directly.*

*First and most generally, Stoics regard wealth and other such externals as “indif f erent,” not as good or bad in themselves. But Stoicism allows that we might legitimately want some of those things – in other words, that some of them are so-called preferred indif f erents.*

**Is not everything able to turn into a preferred indifferent? You don't want to get attached to anything, including anything purely good.

---
Page: 151

*e word “detachment” risks creating the wrong impression, since it can connote a lack of real interest in whatever is the subject of it. at isn’t the idea. Detachment refers more to the way in which something is held and to whether the mind has been given over to it in an excessive way. e detachment of the Stoic thus can be viewed as a kind of moderation – that is, moderation in one’s relationship to externals. A good way to test such a relationship, and to know whether you have an attachment to a thing or just a preference about it, is to consider how well you would handle its loss.*

**In my mind you should maximally enjoy and appreciate what you have and what you gain as well as be grateful for the time you had it when it's gone. You can be detached and loving at the same, they're not mutually exclusive,  they're not even on the same rubrick.

*“Why does a philosopher say that wealth is to be despised, and yet have it? … And why does the philosopher declare that there is no dif f erence between a longer and a shorter life, and then – if nothing stands in the way – prolong his years, and ?ourish peacefully in green old age?” He says those things are to be despised not in order that he not have them, but in order that he not worry about keeping them.*

**You don't have to despise something to be detached from it. It's enough if your definition of love explicitly forbids control over it, and rather wishes for its freedom to be wherever it wants to be. 

---
Page: 152

*Wealth and reputation and power and public of f i ce delight most of all those who least fear their opposites. For the violent desire for each of these implants a most violent fear that they may not remain, and so renders pleasure in them weak and unstable, like a ?uttering ?ame.*

**Attachment create fear, fear distracts you from loving it.

*Moderation is regarded by the Stoic not only as an admired virtue but as a helpful technique. It doesn’t mean “less pleasure”; it means the possibility of actual and lasting pleasure – a way to enjoy something without spoiling it, and without the costs and regrets that come with excess.*

**Good food in excess makes you puke. In moderation it's a source of great pleasure. 

---
Page: 153

*Remember that in life you ought to behave as you would at a banquet. Suppose something is passed around and is across from you. Reach out your hand and take some politely. It passes by: do not hold it back. It has not yet come to you: do not stretch to reach it, but wait till it comes to you. Behave this way toward children, toward a wife, toward wealth, and you will eventually be a worthy fellow banqueter of the gods. But if you do not take the things set before you, and even despise them, then you will be not only a fellow banqueter with the gods, but also a fellow ruler.*

**Delayed gratification is a powerful tool for success. 

---
Page: 155

*e Stoic holds that pleasures arising from natural sources are rightly enjoyed. It merely should be done with moderation. But most of our energies are instead spent chasing short-lived pleasures that we invent or in?ate. Stoics try to align their sense of pleasure with the satisfaction of their actual needs.*

**Even the natural pleasure can be overdone. We stop enjoying them then, they become a chore and we lose time for other things that would bring us happiness as well. 

---
Page: 156

*Desires are either natural and necessary, such as eating and drinking, or natural and not necessary, such as mating with females – or neither natural nor necessary. Almost all of our desires are in this last category; they are all super?uous and arti?cial…. False judgments and ignorance of the good have instilled so many extraneous desires in us that they have chased out most of the natural ones.*

**Are there meaningful subcategories within these categories? Is there a list of all the natural and necessary ones?

*Since everything which exists or happens for a man exists only in his consciousness and happens for it alone, the most essential thing for a man is the constitution of this consciousness, which is in most cases far more important than the circumstances which go to form its contents. All the pride and pleasure of the world, mirrored in the dull consciousness of a fool, are poor indeed compared with the imagination of Cervantes writing his Don Quixote in a miserable prison.*

**To counter this point a little bit, I do think an average mind that gets to experience great things can turn itself into a great mind. And that a great mind might rot if it doesn't expose itself to challenges. 

---
Page: 162

*e ?rst rule of this branch of Stoic teaching is contempt for conformity, for the opinion of the majority, for the habit of looking to others when thinking about what to prefer and how to act. e problem runs deep. A large share of what most people say, think, and do is a product of convention. Its force is hard to resist because getting in line with what others expect causes them to think well of us. Deviating from it tends to be punished swily by others who are more comfortable saying, doing, and enforcing what is expected. Much of Stoicism is the ef f ort to see the truth and act on it, and to learn a noble contempt for the consequences that follow.*

**It requires a lot of practice and fortitude to go against the grain. It's draining but if you perceive it the right way it could be energizing, every time you did that thing that was hard you should know that doing it the next time will be easier. Doing what's right even everybody including yourself is in doubt, is hard mentally but fulfilling for the soul.

*How much trouble he avoids by not looking to see what his neighbor does or thinks – by looking only to what he does himself, that it may be just and pure. e part of the good man is not to peer into the character of others, but to run straight down the line without glancing to one side or the other.*

**Putting it out of your mind is a good strategy. Tunnel vision is helpful at times.

*We tri?e, because we see others tri?e; in the same manner we catch from example the contagion of desire; we see all about us busied in pursuit of imaginary good, and begin to bustle in the same chase, lest greater activity should triumph over us.*

**These desires are very deceptive, sometimes you feel like they were sourced from the inside and you don't bother to question them. Question all your desires and see which ones hold up to scrutiny. Keep the amount of desires you have low, then it'll be easier to scrutinize the ones you have.

Page: 166

*In all we do, almost the ?rst thing we think about is, what will people say; and nearly half the troubles and bothers of life may be traced to our anxiety on this score; it is the anxiety which is at the bottom of all that feeling of self-importance, which is so oen morti?ed because it is so very morbidly sensitive.*

**I believe mothers are to blame for this. Clapping whenever we successfully take a shit or do anything and then even using food as a reward. From the beginning we do things for praise in order to survive. I think it's so important to get rid of this if you want to be self-sufficient as a human.

*Keep constantly in mind who these people are whose admiration you seek, and what guiding principles they have. en you will not blame them when they carelessly of f end you; and you will have no further wish for their approval once you look into the sources of their motives and opinions.*

**Approval is faceless, the fact that we want it from people we don't care about or respect tells you how irrational it is.

*What goes on in other people’s consciousness is, as such, a matter of indif f erence to us; and in time we get really indif f erent to it, when we come to see how super?cial and futile are most people’s thoughts, how narrow their ideas, how mean their sentiments, how perverse their opinions, and how much of error there is in most of them.*

*Do not waste the time you have le thinking about others unless it serves some good and useful purpose, for it takes you away from other work. inking about what so-and-so is doing, and why, and what someone else is saying, and what another is thinking or planning, and all things of that sort, causes you to wander away from the observance of your own governing principles.*

**Scrutinize advise, build a strong foundation with which you can use to think from first principles.

*No one but you knows whether you are cowardly and cruel or loyal and devout. Others never see you; they only guess about you by uncertain conjectures. ey do not see your nature so much as they see your arti?ce. So do not cling to their judgments; cling to your own.*

**It is true that it's only possible to really know yourself. All others are just projections inside each other's minds. Although that projection can feel very real and close. Caring about your projection inside other people's heads is a waste of time.

*What is it to be insulted? Stand by a stone and insult it; what will you gain? And if you listen like a stone, what will be gained by one who insults you? But if he has a stepping-stone in the weakness of his victim, then he accomplishes something.*

**When someone insults you, imagine them throwing those insults at a rock. The words bear no weight. Why not imagine yourself being a mountain?

*Liberty is having a mind superior to injury, a mind that makes itself the only source from which its pleasures spring, that separates itself from all external things, avoiding the unquiet life of one who fears everybody’s laughter, everybody’s tongue.

*You need not be a sage to take insults lightly, but merely someone of sense – one who might say: “Do I deserve these things that happen to me? If I deserve them, there is no insult; it is justice. If I don’t deserve them, let the one who does the injustice blush.”*

**It's very easy to think that you deserve it even though you don't.

*On an individual soldier, a general’s severity may be unleashed; but pardon is unavoidable when the whole army deserts. What takes away the wise man’s anger? e multitude of wrongdoers. He knows how unjust and how dangerous it is to be angry with vice that is widespread.*

**It's not sustainable to be mad about certain things since for some things you'll need to be mad constantly which doesn't serve you well.

Page: 183

*Why is it that we are not stirred up when we meet someone whose body is dis?gured or disabled, yet cannot tolerate a deformed mind without being enraged? Such vicious severity re?ects more on the critic than on the defect.*

**Having pity on stupid people might be a good strategy to ignore what they're saying but I think it's a tool that could potentially backfire and leave you immune to feedback.

*Does a man reproach thee for being proud or ill-natured, envious or conceited, ignorant or detracting? Consider with thy self whether his reproaches are true; if they are not, consider that thou art not the person whom he reproaches, but that he reviles an imaginary being, and perhaps loves what thou really art, tho he hates what thou appearest to be. If his reproaches are true, if thou art the envious ill-natur’d man he takes thee for, give thy self another turn, become mild, af f able and obliging, and his reproaches of thee naturally cease:
his reproaches may indeed continue, but thou art no longer the person whom he reproaches.*

**Having this insight is the first step in turning a critic into a friend. It's very empathetic. 

---
Page: 185

*Whenever someone does you a wrong or speaks ill of you, remember that he is doing what he thinks is proper. He can’t possibly be guided by what appears right to you, but only by what appears right to him.
So if he sees things wrongly, he is the one who is hurt, because he is the one who has been deceived…. Starting from this reasoning, you will be mild toward whoever insults you. Say each time, “So it seemed to him.”*

**People tend to act good according to what appears good to them. Be empathetic towards what they perceive as good, bad and sacred. You might find common ground or you might see that he is completely lost, which you are as well in a certain sense.

Page: 187

*We overrate money and undervalue time, just as we overrate material goods and the approval of others while undervaluing the gains we get by forgoing them. Stoics look at many things that way. When something bad seems to happen, it oen has quiet compensations; exciting opportunities, to the contrary, tend to be costlier than they ?rst seem once their consequences, visible and not, have all been noticed and weighed. Grasping all this helps the Stoic toward an even keel in both circumstances.*

**Make the calculations without letting your conditioning cloud your judgements. But what value base should one use? What's left when all bullshit is carved away? Is there really any judgements to be made by that point?

---
Page: 188

*Our errors of valuation continue with respect to ourselves and others.
We overlook faults in ourselves but ?nd them easily in those around us.
Recognizing this is an encouragement to forgiveness. What another has done that annoys you is probably no worse than what you have done on another day. But the point is also subtler: we condemn in others precisely what we detest but cannot see in ourselves; we project our faults onto them.*

**The worst parts or ourselves are the hardest parts to look at with honesty. We immediately want to turn our heads away from fear of the ugliness that lives inside of us. Ugly parts that we have learned to fear and hate is easy for us to spot in others because we're so familiar with it.

**Our mistakes become ghosts of the past that reminds us that we need to be better. 

---
Page: 191

*Stoics do not think the future should be ignored or met without planning. ey mean that we should pay attention to the present; and they mean that we should carefully make decisions about the future that belong to us, but then waste no energy wondering and worrying about what is to come.*

**Planning when used right is a virtue, memory when used right is a virtue. The mind is a powerful tool but it can tie knots on itself, use it expertly and you'll avoid unnecessary suffering and maximize living.

*Our stupidity can be seen by this, that we only think we have bought those things for which we pay cash, while we regard as free those things for which we expend our very selves. ings that we would never be willing to buy if we had to give our house in exchange, or some attractive and productive estate, we are fully prepared to attain at the cost of anxiety, danger, lost honor, lost freedom, and lost time – for we treat nothing as cheaper than ourselves.*

**When evaluating opportunities you need to consider the effect it has on your time. Will it allow you to spend your time better? Will it allow you to live more virtuously?

*If each of us could have the number of our future years set before us, as we can with the years that have passed, how alarmed we would be, and how sparing of them, if we saw only a few remaining! And while it is easy to manage something when the amount you have is known, even if it is small, you must guard what you have more carefully if you don’t know when it may give out.*

*I ?nd that most of the time we envy others for their wealth, honor, and privilege; but if someone were to say to us, “You can have the same amount that they have for the same price,” we would not want it. For in order to have these things that they do, we must ?atter, we must endure insult and injury, we must give up our freedoms.*

Page: 204

*Self-love is oen rather arrogant than blind; it does not hide our faults from ourselves, but persuades us that they escape the notice of others, and disposes us to resent censures lest we should confess them to be just. We are secretly conscious of defects and vices, which we hope to conceal from the public eye, and please ourselves with innumerable impostures, by which, in reality, nobody is deceived.*

**Self-hate blinds us similarly.

*Whenever you take of f ense at someone else’s fault, turn immediately to ?nd the fault most similar in yourself – such as attachment to money, or pleasure, or reputation, or whatever it might be.

**I think this would help a lot with the frustration I sometimes feel when people disagree with me.

Page: 206

*But sometimes the problem is more insidious. It is not just that we criticize others without re?ecting on our own culpabilities. It is that we see in others precisely those things that we ?nd most uncomfortable in ourselves. In a word, we engage in projection.
e strictest enforcer of loyalty is the traitor, the punisher of falsehood is also a perjurer, and the unscrupulous lawyer deeply resents an indictment brought against himself.*

**This is why virtue signaling is disgusting, because it's coming from the people who are portraying most vividly what they themselves condemn.

*We can form our opinions of that which we know not, only by placing it in comparison with something that we know; whoever, therefore, is over-run with suspicion, and detects arti?ce and stratagem in every proposal, must either have learned by experience or observation the wickedness of mankind, and been taught to avoid fraud by having oen suf f ered or seen treachery, or he must derive his judgment from the consciousness of his own disposition, and impute to others the same inclinations, which he feels predominant in himself.*

*A man bears the weight of his own body without knowing it, but he soon feels the weight of any other, if he tries to move it; in the same way, a man can see other people’s shortcomings and vices, but he is blind to his own. is arrangement has one advantage: it turns other people into a kind of mirror, in which a man can see clearly everything that is vicious, faulty, ill-bred and loathsome in his own nature; only it is generally the old story of the dog barking at its own image; it is himself that he sees and not another dog, as he fancies.*

**In a certain sense everything around us is our own consciousness. Everything ascribed in it is determined by the game engine. It also reminds me of the thousand faces of everything, everyone is part of the same fabric at some level.

*Seneca does not begrudge surges of feeling – tears, trembling, lusts – so long as reason is able to get them under control. ey are considered physical impulses. And he accepts that grief is inevitable aer a loss; he dismisses doubts on that point as quickly as any non-Stoic would. e Stoic’s aim, as he sees it, is to avoid making natural grief worse by talking to ourselves unhelpfully about it and taking our cues from convention. ese are humane counsels.*

**It's the unthinking knee-jerk reactions that are undesirable. Sloppy, non-original thinking. It's worse to regurgitate someone else's thoughts and be right than to be wrong while answering with your own mind. That's not to say that you can't use someone else's thinking, but if you don't add your own thoughts to it your just a zombie.

*It suggests that the Stoic tries to respond to events in a manner similar to what would be expected of anyone aer long experience with them – the kind of response you might have aer encountering the occasion for it a thousand times. e result is not an uncaring or unfeeling attitude, though it will probably not involve much emotion. It is the posture of the veteran.*

*Nor do the Stoics believe that the soul of their sage can resist visions and imaginings when they ?rst surprise him. Rather, they concede that it is in his nature to react to a loud noise from the sky or from a collapsing building (for example) by turning pale and tense; and likewise for all other emotions, provided his judgment remains sound and intact, that the seat of his reason does not suf f er any damage or change, and that he does not give consent to his fear and pain.*

*Now, am I urging you to be hard-hearted, do I ask that you betray no emotion at the funeral, do I refuse to let your spirit even be touched?
Not at all. It would be barbarous, not courageous, to watch the burial rites of one’s own – with the same eyes that watched them while living – and not be moved as one’s family is ?rst torn apart. Suppose I did forbid it: some things have rights of their own. Tears fall even from those trying to hold them back; being shed, they li the spirit.
What, then, shall we do? Let us allow them to fall, but not order them to do so; let there be as much weeping as emotion may produce, not as much as imitation may demand. Let us add nothing to grief, nor enlarge it to match the example of someone else.*

**Not being authentic is the wrong way to grieve.

*From a Stoic perspective, fears are opinions about what is to come. ose opinions can be reduced to a series of things that the fearful person must believe, even if they aren’t conscious or articulate – a belief that a certain thing is going to happen, that it is going to be terrible, that it is worth getting upset about now. e Stoics regard most such propositions as mistaken, and would defeat fear by dismantling them.
First, fearful things should be examined directly, and their realism severely tested.*

**I wonder why I'm afraid. Do all my fears have the same root? In some sense I feel that I want peace because I can't deal with the chaos that comes with conflict. Chaos meaning both physical and psychological abuse. Why do I feel fear? 

**Fear viewed from this angle comes down to knowledge. Most things are probably not to be feared, but we don't know it because the fear prevents us from investigating it empirically. I fear talking to this person because I think I'll be rejected. I don't have a basis for that fear because I've never tried and been rejected.

*Weigh your hopes against your fears. When everything is uncertain, favor your own side: believe what you prefer. If fear obtains more votes, bend more the other way nevertheless and stop troubling yourself.*

**I think I've lost the ability to see hope in situations requiring conflict. I need to start being more optimistic about my own intentions.

*e things that terrify you, as if they were about to happen, may never come; certainly they have not come yet. Some things torment us more than they should, some before they should, some when they should not torment us at all.*

**Be honest about the likelihood of the outcomes that you're afraid of. Are they really going to happen? If not then it's a big waste to be afraid of them. It's kind of like the risk reward calculation that people misjudge when it comes to starting your own company.

*And what if it does? Suppose, ?nally, that your fears do end up being realized. Maybe they are not so bad aer all if looked at realistically; or their ultimate consequences may be harder to judge than they seem. In any event, you will deal with them by use of the same resources that allow you to cope here and now.*

**I'm still stuck having a child's view of certain fears, a child's view in the sense that everything is much bigger than it really is. Go into what's making you afraid and learn what happens, in most cases the fear will turn out to have been wrong to have.

*Reason considers nothing but the question at issue; anger is moved by tri?ing things that lie outside the case. An overcon?dent demeanor, a voice too loud, unrestrained speech, overre?ned attire, over-solicitous advocacy, popularity with the public – anger is in?amed by all of them. Many times it will condemn the accused because it hates his lawyer; even if the truth is piled up before its very eyes, it loves error and upholds it; it refuses to be convinced, and counts persistence in what is wrongly begun to be more honorable than penitence.*

**It's interesting how single-minded you become when angry. It turns everything into means of destroying the subject of anger. Destruction doesn't serve anyone but it will act as a selection mechanism.

*If you will look at the ef f ects of anger, and at the harm it has done, no plague has been more costly to mankind. You will see slaughters and poisonings, the mutual vileness of litigants, the downfall of cities and the destruction of entire nations; princes sold into slavery at auction, houses put to the torch, ?res not con?ned within city walls but vast stretches of countryside aglow with enemy ?ame.*

**If you'd solve anger you might solve war.

*We should bring ourselves to see all the vices of the crowd not as hateful but as ridiculous; and we should imitate Democritus rather than Heraclitus. For the latter, every time he went out into public, used to weep; the former used to laugh. One saw everything we do as wretchedness, the other as absurdity. ings should be made light of, and taken more easily: it is more civilized to laugh at life than to bewail it.*

**Comedy might be the key. When you feel a surge of anxiety, try instantly to find what's funny in the situation. I can do this easily with pain. It's a great relief valve.

*It is good humor at the expense of oneself, and about the af f ronts one receives, that is fully endorsed by the Stoic. Self-ef f acing humor disarms an opponent and makes the user of it a less appealing target of attack. (See Chapter 7, Section 11.) Humor has other uses that the Stoics recognize as well; one who manages to be amused by an attack rises above it and diminishes the attacker. Above all, however – and most to our point – humor can cause anger to dissolve.*

**It'll be an infinite source of comedy material as attacks will keep coming forever.

*e best corrective of anger lies in delay. Ask this concession from anger at the outset, not in order that it may pardon, but in order that it may judge. Its ?rst assaults are heavy; it will leave of f if it waits.
And do not try to destroy it all at once; attacked piecemeal, it will be conquered completely.*

**A big source of regret is that you were not able to say the right things in the moment. Adding delay helps us with some aspects of anger but not all. Perhaps the point is that no good decisions will come up in the moment. Instead of trying, add the delay always. 

**Anger attacked in piecemeal is new to me and it makes sense. Great things can be accomplished incrementally and iteratively. It's about breaking down a problem that's to big to tackle all at once.

*Suspicion and surmise – those deceptive provocations – ought to be banished from the mind. “is man did not give me a civil greeting;
that one did not embrace me as I kissed him; that one broke of f the conversation abruptly; that one did not invite me to dinner; that one tried to avoid seeing me.” Grounds for suspicion will never be lacking. But we need to be straightforward and to see things in their best light. We should believe only what is thrust under our eyes and becomes unmistakable. And every time our suspicion proves to be groundless we should blame our own credulity; this rebuke will develop the habit of being slow to believe.*

**I generally lean towards suspending disbelief and suspicion. When I don't I quickly turn into a nasty man, because everyone is out to get me. It's the epitome of hubris and paranoia. Why do you think that people care so much about you that they'd go out of their way to be malicious to you?

*What is more unworthy of the wise man than that his emotions should depend on the wickedness of others? Shall great Socrates lose the power to carry back home the same look he had when he le? If the wise man is to be angered by low deeds, if he is to be upset and unsettled by crimes, surely nothing is more woeful than the wise man’s lot; his whole life will be passed in anger and in grief. For what moment will there be when he will not see something to disapprove of ?
Seneca, On Anger 2.7.1 at passage alludes to what Xanthippe, the wife of Socrates, is recorded as having said about him: “that when the State was oppressed with a thousand miseries, Socrates still always went out and came home with the same look.
For he bore a mind smooth and cheerful on all occasions, far remote from grief and above all from fear.”*

**Wrongful fear and anger are utterly useless. Most bad and tough things in the world don't warrant it. If you'd come home dejected everytime you witnessed some evil or was the target of it, then you'd be a slave to others and your own judgements. The wiser you are the more of the ugly parts of the world will be known to you, you need a way of dealing with that.

**What counts as rightful fear and anger? Surely there's a place in the universe for those two.

*He will look to the future, not to the past. For as Plato says: “A sensible person does not punish a man because he has done wrong, but in order to keep him from doing wrong; for while the past cannot be recalled, the future may be forestalled.” And he will openly kill those whom he wishes to have serve as examples of the wickedness that is slow to yield, not so much that they themselves may be destroyed as that their destruction may deter others. ese are the things a man must weigh and consider, and you see how free he ought to be from all emotion when he proceeds to deal with a matter that requires the utmost caution – the use of power over life and death.*

**When something bad has happened the only thing you should be thinking about is how to create a better future. 

**Justice is not about punishment, though punishment might be a means for enacting it, justice is about setting things right for the future.

*Stoic detachment does not imply a shortage of engagement with the world or reluctance to act in it. e detachment of the Stoic is a technique for preserving one’s equilibrium and seeing the world accurately. e requirements of justice are a separate matter, and one very important to the Stoics. Choices about how to spend one’s time and energy are likewise a separate issue – one on which the Stoic advice is exactly the opposite of withdrawal.*

**A balanced temperament is a way of caring more deeply since you become more effective than if you'd be dragged around be your emotions.

*Reason will have accomplished enough if it removes from grief only what is both excessive and super?uous; that reason should not allow grief to exist at all is neither to be hoped nor desired. Rather let reason establish a measure that will copy neither indif f erence nor madness, and will keep us in the state that is the mark of an af f ectionate, and not an unbalanced, mind. Let your tears ?ow, but let them also cease; let deepest sighs be drawn from your breast, but let those, too, come to an end; so rule your mind that you can win approval both from wise men and from brothers.*

**Be natural and spontaneous, but don't be a shallow copy of someone else.

*No one is less pleased by your grief than the person to whom it seems to be of f ered. Either he does not want you to suf f er, or he does not know that you do. So your supposed duty has no point. If he for whom it is performed is unaware of it, it is useless; if he is aware of it, he does not like it. I may say boldly that there is no one in the whole wide world who takes the slightest pleasure in your tears.*

**What is grief? Is it painful to get the brain to start changing the role of the lost one in its models?

*If we believe our friend Attalus, “inking of friends who are alive and well is like enjoying honey and cake; the remembrance of friends who have died delights us, but with a certain bitterness. Yet who will deny that sour things, with a touch of sharpness, can also whet the appetite?” I don’t agree: thinking of my deceased friends is sweet and pleasant to me. I had them as if I was going to lose them; I have lost them as if I have them still.*

**I hadn't really thought of enjoying bad memories from time to time. I suppose it's a good way to discharge whatever emotions are associated with it.

*Stoicism of f ers a series of strategies for turning adversity to good. We cannot choose what happens to us, but we can choose how to react to it. So when a setback comes, Stoics interpret it as constructively as possible – as a chance to prove oneself, or to learn, or to build anew; and the value of any of these responses may be greater than the cost of the adversity.*

**The most deceptive killer is the slowdrip death. Setbacks that fly under the radar don't trigger a reaction but they accumulate and when you notice them it's already too late.

*A healthy eye should see all there is to see, not say “I want to see green things” – for that is a sign that the eyes are diseased. And healthy hearing and a healthy sense of smell should be ready for all that there is to be heard and smelled…. So, too, a healthy mind should be ready for whatever may come to pass. e mind that says, “Let my children be safe,” and “Let everyone praise whatever I may do,” is an eye that seeks green things, or teeth that seek out only what is tender.*

**Let the mind be mind.

*We must learn to put up with what we cannot avoid. Our life, like the harmony of the world, is composed of contrary things – of diverse tones, sweet and harsh, sharp and ?at, sprightly and solemn. e musician who only loved some of them – what would he be able to do? He has to know how to make use of them all, and be able to mix them together. We must do the same with the good and the bad, which are of the same substance as our lives.*

*“is cucumber is bitter.” row it away. “ere are brambles in the road.” Turn aside. at’s enough.

*Hermes’ magic wand. Stoics view adversity, or developments contrary to one’s wishes, as misjudged in various ways we can now consider. Adversity is a raw material needed for building strong things. To adjust the comparison:
an unwanted card has been dealt, or the dice have come up a certain way;
the Stoic goal is to avoid even the feeling of “oh, no” wherever possible on these occasions, and to replace it with sentiments closer to “now what?” or “let’s see what can be done with this.” e work of life is to turn whatever happens to constructive ends. at is the most important Stoic idea about adversity, and a theme to which all of its authors contribute, oen with metaphors. Epictetus adapted for Stoic use the caduceus, or wand, that Hermes was said to use to perform feats of magic. But the alchemy the Stoic has in mind turns adversity into advantage.*

**What prevents one from greeting every challenge with a smile? It's pain. It's disagreement. It's about feeling like a slave.

*Do you think that the wise man is burdened by evils? He makes use of them. It was not only from ivory that Phidias knew how to make statues; he made them also from bronze. If you had given him marble, or some still lesser material, he would have carved the best statue that could be made of it. So the wise man will display virtue amid riches if possible, but if not, in poverty; at home if he can, but if not, in exile; as a general if he can, but if not, as a soldier; in sound health if he can, but if not, then in weakness. Whatever fortune he is dealt, he will make of it something remarkable.*

**What can one make out of melancholy? One can make beautiful poetry. One can make the sad the reason for the happy. One can do so many different things. Take action. Be truthful. Do the best you can with what's in your control and don't let what's out of your control affect you badly, go with the flow.

*By the aid of philosophy you will live not unpleasantly, for you will learn to extract pleasure from all places and things.

**Are there other ways to discover your own potential than great challenges? I don't think so, but I think that you can have many different types of challenges. A great challenge for an author might be to be able to step aside for his characters. A great challenge for a scientist might be to throw away his own work when truth has disproved it.

*Without an adversary, virtue shrivels. We see how great and how powerful it really is, only when it shows by endurance what it is capable of. Be assured that good men should act likewise; they should not shrink from hardships and dif f i culties, nor complain against fate; we should make the best of whatever happens and turn it to good.*

**When do you determine that the challenge isn't the right one? Can it ever be the wrong challenge? Probably not but the way the challenge is interpreted can be wrong. If someone spits in your face, the challenge is not how you can get back at the person, but how you can deal with your anger.

*Events that seem terrible when they happen sometimes result in greater things later. is may be because the process of recovery produces a result that surpasses whatever was destroyed. Or it may be because the later events lead, even fortuitously, to a new and better result in some way that was hard to foresee. e general point: we usually take a short-term view of developments we don’t like, and are poor judges of what their ultimate consequences will be. Events that look bad should therefore be judged with humility and calm.*

**Life is very unpredictable so the principles of non-objective search suits it better at times.

*“What can happen to one can happen to any.” If a man will let this sink into his inmost heart, and if he will look on all the evils besetting other people, of which there is daily an immense supply, in this light – as if there is nothing to stop them from ?nding him, too – he will arm himself long before he is attacked. It is too late to equip the mind for the endurance of dangers aer the dangers have come.*

**I think this touches an important point on learning deeply. If we just have shallow knowledge of the stoic practices they will be of no use when we need them the most. Everyday things happen where you can practice, if you aren't challenged enough then do something to put challenges in your way.

*e main reason why misfortune falls less heavily upon us, if we have looked upon its occurrence as not impossible, and, as the saying is, prepared ourselves for it, may be this: if, before this misfortune comes, we have quietly thought over it as something which may or may not happen, the whole of its extent and range is known to us….
But if no preparation has been made to meet it, and it comes unexpectedly, the mind is in a state of terror for the moment and unable to measure the full extent of the calamity; it seems so far-reaching in its ef f ects that the victim might well think there was no limit to them; in any case, its range is exaggerated. In the same way, darkness and uncertainty always increase the sense of danger.*

**Will having a disposition of anticipating evil have any negative effects? Like making your outlook on life more pessimistic and grim? I suppose it could have but only if you let it. What it should make you do is appreciate whatever you have at the moment. 

---
Page: 256

*ere is some use in occasionally looking upon terrible misfortunes – such as might happen to us – as though they had actually happened, for then the trivial reverses which subsequently come in reality, are much easier to bear. It is a source of consolation to look back upon those great misfortunes which never happened.*

**It's like looking past where you're going in order to throw further. Whatever comes your way is not as bad as it could be. Look at the worse possible outcomes with equanimity, don't let it frighten you, let it harden you but don't forget to be smooth like water. For if the worse would come to be, you need to be agile, flexible and on point.

*Adaptation isn’t always bene?cial. It can cause one to get used to bad things that ought to be ?xed, or to good things that go unappreciated. (See Chapter 13, Section 1 for some more discussion.) But adaptation is unquestionably a great aid in making peace with adversities that cannot be helped. Most things that bother us when they arrive become more bearable once we are accustomed to them.*

**You should probably take an inventory of the pains and evils you've become numb to and evaluate whether you should do something about it. It's not intellectually honest to carry unnecessary evils, it's immature and macho.

*Some states of mind are dif f i cult to acquire directly; they come about only as byproducts of ef f ort applied in other directions. Many have found that happiness is this way. Ef f orts to acquire it by direct pursuit don’t work well;
happiness has to be found while looking for something else. (is is a point oen rediscovered in modern times with much fanfare.) e something else proposed by the Stoic consists primarily of a dedication to reason and a commitment to others – to service, to justice, to helping in the ways one can.
ese are appealing values to live by whether or not they are accompanied by a logical guarantee of their correctness. ey also may be found a dependable path to happiness, or a more reliable one than any other. But recall that putting happiness aside just in order to ?nd it later is cheating;
happiness is not supposed to be the Stoic goal, not even covertly. e Stoic view, rather, is that one should embrace virtue for its own sake, and that doing so is necessary to get the good side ef f ects of it.*

**Trying to feign non-objective principles won't fool anybody but the stupid part of yourself. Love the journey, put any goals out of your mind or else all your actions will have a touch of dishonesty to them. Though if you try you will fail, you need to just be.

Page: 259

*e Stoics, as we have seen, have various ways of advancing their views and making them persuasive. ey attempt to base their ideas about virtue mostly on logic; the Greeks in particular sought to establish their ethical conclusions by a coherent system of deductions. ey held that nature commands us to live in obedience to reason and designed us to gravitate toward virtue.*

**Finding the true theory of virtue and morality is still possible. Our AI friends might be able to fish it out for us. We might need the next level of intelligence.

Page: 259

*Virtue is the natural result of an accurate use of reason; reason is the distinct gi that sets humanity apart from animals, so the purpose of human life must be found there. Earlier chapters have shown us much of what reason means to the Stoics. For one thing – and most relevant here – it should cause us to accurately see our individual insigni?cance (a theme of Chapter 3); and from this we might infer our corresponding place in the world, which is to function faithfully as parts of a whole.*

**The value system that you have is arbitrary until we scientifically solve virtue and ethics but the point is to have a value system. Having one will let you live in accordance to something greater than yourself and as such you will have a compass that tells whether you're going in the right direction. Having said that, it kind of feels like it can be somewhat delusional, especially considering the arbitrariness of the value system. Set up the best possible value system given your current knowledge and then revisit it often, then you'll get the best of both worlds.

*is may be taught quickly and in a few words. Virtue is the only good, or at least there is no good without virtue; virtue itself is situated in our nobler part, that is, the rational part. And what will this virtue be? True and steadfast judgment. From this will spring the impulses of the mind; by this, every external appearance that stirs such an impulse will be reduced to transparency.*

**A solid foundation may be necessary to give room for spontaneity. And it'll help you see things for what they are, not what the cloudy part of your mind wants them to be.

Still, there are many other qualities about which you don’t have to say, “I just wasn’t born with it.” So show them those qualities that are entirely up to you: sincerity, dignity, endurance of hardship; not pleasure-seeking, not complaining of your lot, needing little;
kindness and generosity; being modest, not chattering idly, but high-minded. Don’t you see how many you could display immediately – having no excuse on account of lack of natural capacity or aptitude – yet you still willingly fall short?*

*You know from experience how far you have wandered without ?nding the good life anywhere: not in logic, not in wealth, not in fame, not in pleasure – nowhere. Where is it found, then? In doing what human nature wishes. How is that done? By having principles that govern your impulses and actions. What principles? ose concerned with what is good and evil – that there is nothing good for man except what makes him just, moderate, brave, and free, and nothing evil except that which produces the opposite.*

**Principles can act as the foundation of your house in a stormy, constantly changing world.

*ose only are happy (I thought) who have their minds ?xed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end.

*True consistency would mean always thinking the same thing is right and never deviating from it. It also would mean acting and thinking the same way in all settings – in public, at home, and alone, never phony; for phoniness may accurately enough be described not only as dishonesty but as a form of inconsistency. Someone who managed to be consistent in the senses just described would, the Stoic suggests, inevitably be virtuous.*

*We have seen Seneca and Marcus Aurelius refer to the value of compassion.
at is a nuanced topic for the Stoics. eir philosophy calls for a felt sense that all of humanity are their relations. It also calls for help to those who need it. But the Stoic does not favor compassion in the dif f erent sense of feeling sorry for other people and making their sadness one’s own – that is, becoming despondent because others are despondent. Seneca’s position was that good Stoics will do all that would be done by anyone who feels pity for others, but that they will not feel the pity themselves; pity is considered a form of distress that serves no purpose and impairs good judgment.*

**Sam Harris makes a distinction between empathy and compassion where empathy is about embodying the feeling of the other whereas compassion is about feeling loving kindness towards them.

*e mind should be summoned every day to render an accounting.
Sextius used to do this. At the end of the day, when he had withdrawn to his nightly rest, he would interrogate his own mind:
“Which of your wrongs did you correct today? Which fault did you resist? In what way are you better?” Anger will leave of f and be more moderate, if it knows that it must each day come before a judge. Is there anything ?ner than this habit of searching through the entire day? … When the light has been removed and my wife, long aware of my habit, has become silent, I scan the whole of my day and retrace all my deeds and words.*

*Begin the morning by saying to yourself: today I will meet with the busybody, the ungrateful, and the arrogant; with the deceitful, the envious, and the unsocial. All these things result from their not knowing what is good and what is evil. But I have seen the nature of the good – that it is beautiful; and the nature of evil, and that it is ugly; and the nature of him who does wrong, and that he is akin to me – not because he is from the same blood and seed, but because he partakes of the same mind and the same small bit of divinity. I cannot be injured by any of them, because no one can involve me in anything ugly except myself. And how can I be angry with my kin, or hateful towards them?*

Choose the one whose life, whose speech, whose forthright countenance, all satisfy you; then show him always to yourself as your guardian and model. We need someone, I say, against whose example our own conduct can measure itself. You can’t straighten what’s crooked without a ruler.*

**Why not make it a council? I have a few candidates to include.  Hold yourself to a higher standard and add mental mentors that'll help you do it. When you're alone against the pressures of the masses, one person standing on your side can make all the difference.

*Meditation. Sometimes Stoicism is helped by just contemplating it, and by reading and writing. It is both a way of life and a way of thought. Rehearsal of accurate thinking is how one practices Stoicism and how one improves at it.*

**Applying knowledge in practice is crucial for hardening it. Building a strong foundation will let you deal with unforeseen and difficult setbacks. If your philosophy fails when you need it the most it it's useless.

*I must die; so must I also die regretting something? I must be put in chains; must I also be wailing about something? I must be banished;
does anyone prevent me from leaving with a smile, cheerful and easy-going? “Reveal your secrets.” I don’t speak; this much is up to me. “en I will put you in chains.” Man, what are you saying? Me?
You can chain my leg, but Zeus himself can’t overcome my will. “I’ll throw you in prison.” My poor body, you mean. “I’ll cut your head of f .” When did I ever tell you that my neck was the only one that could not be severed? ese are the things philosophers should think about, should write down daily, should use as exercise.*

**If you want to change your mind you need to fully commit and exercise as much as when you do the same for your body.

*We owe to our ?rst journeys the discovery that place is nothing. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I ?ed from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I af f ect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.*

**You will never find the answer in external things. Physiologically your dopamine won't let you. Rewire yourself to have control over the dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms and you'll be able to feel what you want when you want it. 

**What would happen if we got artificial control over all our feelings? I think that you'd still be in a trap because the controller would still be the you that failed to conquer yourself without the artificial crutches. You'd be a monkey with a machine gun, you'd turn on the happiness valve when you aren't able to deal with your sadness, etc. The tie between where your heads at and what you're feeling would be severed. You'd destroy the signal you get from your feelings.

*Skilled wrestlers are trained by practice. A musician is inspired by one of equal pro?ciency. e wise man also needs to have his virtues exercised; thus in the same way that he stirs himself, he is stirred by another wise man.*

*ey seek out retreats for themselves – places in the country, seashores, the mountains – and you too are accustomed to crave such things especially. All this is utterly amateurish, since it is possible to retreat into oneself any time you like.*

*A man who frequently consorts with certain others, whether for conversation, for banquets, or just generally for good fellowship, must either become like them or else change them along his own lines. For if you put a charcoal that has gone out next to one that is burning, either the ?rst will extinguish the second or the second will ignite the ?rst. Since the danger is so great, we should enter very cautiously into social relations of this sort with laymen, and remember that it is impossible for the man who rubs up against someone covered with soot to avoid getting the bene?t of some soot himself.*

**If you have a solid enough foundation and an iron will you will not let bad people influence your mind. Though be careful of prolonged exposure because normalization is hard to avoid.

*Just as those who have been to a concert carry away in their heads the tunes and the charm of the songs – and just as they get in the way of thinking, and won’t let you concentrate on serious things – so the talk of ?atterers and those who praise depravity sticks in the ears long aer it is heard. It is not easy to drive the agreeable sound out of your mind: it continues, and lasts, and comes back from time to time. You should therefore close your ears to evil sayings right from the start. Once they have gained an entrance and been admitted to our minds, they become more daring.*

**You need an information and wisdom diet. Don't associate with people who are bad and if you can't avoid it be disgusted by their behavior so it doesn't rub off.

*Greed will cling to you so long as you are living with someone greedy and low; so will a swelled head, so long as you keep company with someone arrogant. You’ll never be free of cruelty if you’re sharing a tent with an executioner. e fellowship of adulterers will in?ame your own lusts. If you want to be stripped of your vices, you must withdraw far from vicious exemplars. e greedy man, the seducer, the cruel one, the cheat – all capable of much harm, if they should be anywhere near you – are inside you.*

**A silly example is in keeping a good diet, if all you're friends eat shit, chances are you'll increase the amount of shit you eat.

*A problem related to the company we keep is our relationship to the social world at large, as when one goes out in public. is is an important issue for the Stoic, because the philosophy calls for engagement with public af f airs but also for resistance to popular judgments and contempt for them. e Stoic shouldn’t avoid the crowd, then, but has to maintain a careful relationship to it. Epictetus takes a benevolent view of massed humanity, comparing it to pleasing masses of farm animals.*

**A modern example is to use social media and not let it use you.

*Never call yourself a philosopher, and don’t talk much among laymen about philosophical principles, but act according to them….
And if you should come upon a discussion among laymen about some philosophical principle, keep silent for the most part; for there is great danger that you will immediately vomit up what you have not digested. And when someone says to you that you know nothing, and you’re not stung by the taunt, know then that you are making headway. Sheep don’t throw up their grass to show the shepherd how much they have eaten; aer digesting the grass inside, they bear wool and milk outside. So for you, too: don’t display your learning to the uninstructed: display the actions that result from the digestion of it.*

**Flaunting your virtue is about as ugly as it gets. All your virtue gets thrown out the window when you brag about it and it's obvious you missed the point in the first place. Virtue is for your soul only.

*e mind is not like a bucket that requires ?lling, it is like wood that needs igniting – nothing more – to produce an impulse to discovery and a longing for the truth. Imagine that someone needing ?re from his neighbors, and ?nding there a big blazing one, just stayed warming himself until the ?re burned out. It’s the same if someone who comes to another man to get his thinking does not realize that he ought to strike some light of his own and kindle his own ideas, but – delighted by what he is hearing – just sits there enchanted.*

**You need to be able to think for yourself. It's comforting to echo other people's thoughts but it doesn't allow you to grow and transcend and to be flexible in the face of adversity.

*at is why we give children maxims to learn by heart … because a child’s mind can grasp them, when it can’t yet handle more. But for a grown man, whose progress is de?nite, it is disgraceful to cling to gems of rhetoric, to prop himself up with the best-known and briefest sayings, to depend on his memory: for by now he should be relying on himself. He should make such maxims and not memorize them.*

**There's courage in being original. There's courage in standing at the edge of darkness and lighting the candles for others to dare to walk the same path.

*It is through speech and other such forms of instruction that one must progress toward perfection, and purify one’s will, and correct the faculty that makes use of impressions. And instruction in those principles calls for a certain style of presentation, and a certain vividness and variety in the way they are expressed. So some students become captivated by these things and remain stuck there – one a captive of style, another of syllogisms, another of ambiguities, another in some other roadside inn of the same kind, and there they remain and waste away, as if among the Sirens.*

**Talk is cheap but action moves the world. It's easy to get caught up in your own fantasies when you don't let the real world give you feedback.

*Armies have put up with deprivations of every kind; they have lived on the roots of plants, and have staved of f hunger in ways too revolting to mention. All these things they have suf f ered for the sake of a kingdom – even more wonderful, for the sake of someone else’s kingdom! Who, then, will hesitate to put up with poverty in order to free his mind from madness?*

**The more importance we can ascribe to something the more our brain will help us achieve it.

*ere are a thousand other instances in which persistence surmounts every obstacle, showing that nothing is dif f i cult if the mind orders itself to endure it.*

**The trick is to order the mind and get it to be convinced of what must be done. Setting a good foundation and trusting it,  then setting a purpose to fight for using your foundation as the guiding mechanism. If you set a purpose you can't convince yourself of, discard it or strengthen it and repeat until you're mind couldn't see itself doing anything other than what it needs to do. I'd like to mix this with non-objective search, if you let your foundation drive rather than a Northstar then you'll end up in an interesting place and you'll have done it in a way that you can be proud of.

*So oen I meet people who think that whatever they can’t do, can’t be done; who say that we are always talking of things greater than human nature can bear. But how much more favorable is my own estimation of them! ey too can do these things, but they don’t want to. And besides, did these tasks ever fail anyone who tried to achieve them? Was there anyone to whom they did not seem easier in the doing? Our lack of con?dence is not the result of dif f i culty.
e dif f i culty comes from our lack of con?dence.*

**There's a big difference between doing and trying. When you start doing it'll become effortless.

*We suf f er from diseases that are curable, and our very nature assists us – since we were born to follow the right path – if we are willing to be improved. Nor is the road to the virtues steep and rough, as some have thought: they are reached by a level path. I do not come to give you false advice. e way to the happy life is easy. Just take the ?rst step, with good auspices and the help of the gods themselves. It is much more dif f i cult to do what you are doing now.*

**The suffering that we're feeling by opposing our very nature is of course much worse than the suffering of the discipline to live in accordance with our full potential.

*what the Stoics wish to avoid are emotions or other states that interfere with the ability to see the world accurately – states of feeling, in other words, that get in the way of reason and arise from (or create) attachment to externals. Stoics have no dif f i culty with states that do not have those sources and ef f ects. As a temporary convenience, I proposed in Chapter 9 to refer to the good or unobjectionable states as feelings as distinct from emotions. e dif f erence between feeling and emotion is important – or the dif f erence, however it might better be worded, between those states that oust reason and those that are no threat to it and so do not trouble the Stoics. It matters because states of feeling, as so de?ned, may well be necessary to motivate compassion and otherwise contribute to admirable character. Emotion probably isn’t.*

**Sometimes a feeling is absolutely required to see the world accurately, in fact sometimes it's your feelings that shout truths that your reason wants to suppress.

*Suppose you lived a life long enough to experience such grieving friends 1,000 times, and imagine your likely reaction when approached by the next friend – number 1,001. Not everyone reacts to repeated experience the same way, so take the most appealing scenario. Your attitude might resemble that of a doctor – a very good one, let’s say – who has had a long career of working with dying patients and their families. In the best doctor of that sort we would ?nd kindness, warmth, and compassion. ere would be feeling. But emotion would be unlikely. You would sympathize but you would not go through mourning of your own.
You would have seen it all too many times for that.*

**Reminds me of Frieren, who has a pretty expressionless face but a rich inner world and great insight into many things.

*Only the novice is in?ated and grasping and fearful; but we are all novices. Life is regrettably short because it does not allow us enough trials to become as wise as we would wish. Stoic philosophy is a compensation – a substitute for time, or simulation of it. Stoicism means to of f er the wisdom while skipping the repetition; it tries to get by contemplation some of the lessons, immunities, and other features of character we would acquire naturally if we lived long enough. e “wise man” of the Stoics thus resembles one who has had long experience of life – far longer, perhaps, than anyone is able to have in fact. Stoicism is the philosophy of a thousand trials.*

**Some of us are lucky enough to get more trials than others, giving us a chance to become wiser than we otherwise would be.

Page: 303

*ere is nothing ugly in the type of character produced by long experience, or at least nothing necessarily so. It can be unattractive; sometimes experience jades us and dulls our capacities. But there is nobility in it when joined with compassion.
Stoicism demands this. It seeks to create not just the mind matured by many trials, but the best version of it – the doctor who has learned with the passage of much time to care well and energetically for the patient, not the doctor who is bored.*

**Don't let time and experience wear you down, let it sharpen and perfect you.

*e connection between Stoicism and the consequences of time can be extended. ink of the ef f ect that repetition has on other emotions. What is frightening at ?rst usually becomes nothing, or loses force, with long enough exposure. e source of the fear doesn’t change; the mind does. Or imagine making a fortune and losing it a thousand times over, or loving and grieving a thousand times. You might not stop caring about these things, and might not want to. But you would probably gain a sense of equanimity about them and meet them with a certain detachment – with feeling but with reason, and thus without emotion. Little would likely be le of greed and vanity, either, aer so much gain and loss. Experience is humbling.
Instead you might have other types of joy – the calm kind that comes from appreciation and understanding.*

**I like the notion of speeding up what has been proven to work. 

**When you haven't been rich before you tread carefully on the way there, holding every penny tightly. Once you've been around the block once you'll be able to do the same thing again but more relaxed.

*ese claims about the ef f ects of experience and inexperience can be restated in terms referenced earlier in the book. e Stoic seeks the most useful perspective on all occasions. I have emphasized here that, with respect to emotion and adversity, Stoics want the kind of wisdom that we associate with long experience. But in certain settings they seek, in ef f ect, the attitude of the newcomer.*

**The wise man is able to shift into different minds. When he looks for inspiration and awe he has a beginner's mind, when he needs good judgement he has a veteran's mind.

*Dryden of f ers another familiar critique of Stoicism: that its teachings are impossible to carry out. To repeat the point that provokes the criticism, the Stoics say we should try to control what is up to us and avoid attachment to what is not. Our judgments, and our reactions to events, are up to us; the events themselves aren’t. Stoics sometimes express the idea by depicting a “wise man” (or sapiens) who, by use of these principles, is free from desires and fears. No such wise man has ever been identi?ed, and some dismiss Stoicism on this account as a philosophy that doesn’t work.*

**Being attached the stoicism wouldn't be very stoic. Many philosophies have gems in them, take those and leave the rest. Remember, when you're consciously trying to find the answer it doesn't matter what you do because you can't find it by looking for it. You are already it.

*e wise man of the Stoics is an ideal, that is to say, a human being existing only in thought and in complete conformity with the idea of wisdom. As the idea provides a rule, so the ideal serves as an archetype for the perfect and complete determination of the copy.
us the conduct of this wise and divine man serves us as a standard of action, with which we may compare and judge ourselves, which may help us to reform ourselves, although the perfection it demands can never be attained by us.*

**We can only approximate it, and the higher the bar the higher we will reach.

*No one is worthy of the gods except he who has disdained riches. I do not forbid you to possess them, but I want to bring you to the point at which you possess them without fear. ere is only one way to achieve this: by persuading yourself that you can live happily without them, and by regarding them always as about to depart.*

**This applies to any good fortune.

*“You speak one way, you live another.” You creatures most spiteful, hostile to all the best men! is is the same taunt they threw at Plato, at Epicurus, at Zeno: for all of them were teaching not how they themselves lived, but how they ought to live. I am speaking of virtue, not of myself, and when I denounce vices, I denounce my own ?rst of all. As soon as I can, I’ll live as I should.*

**I'd like to preface every conversation I have about philosophy, morals and virtue with this. I'm the least virtuous of everyone, I fail at everything but that doesn't make what's really virtuous less virtuous or any truth less true.

Page: 317

*Suppose – plausibly, I think – that typical students of Stoicism advance only slightly toward its goals. ey end up with a little less anxiety over what they can’t control, and a little more patience with irritation, indignity, and misfortune; a bit more resistance to convention in their thinking, and somewhat less desire or fear directed at things undeserving of either, and so forth. In other words, they make some modest progress. ere are those who get more than that from the philosophy, and some get less, but imagine that this much were a common result. ose are paltry gains compared to the attainment of sagehood, but considerable compared to a baseline without them. ey are considerable, too, compared to the results of other kinds of philosophical study (how much more does any philosophy do for its students?). It would be foolish to regard small improvements with contempt when it is so rare to ?nd any other kind. So if Stoics seek great things but get only part way there, the discrepancy should not cause them to be thought of as hypocrites. ey aimed high, fell short, and did well.*

**Philosophies can be considered toolkits. If you have some tools that will help you in some way, make use of them until you find better tools to use.
