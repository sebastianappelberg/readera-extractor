*The story goes that by the late 1950s, a large number of apparently elementary particles, called hadrons, was discovered. Neutrons and protons are both hadrons, and of course they play major roles in everyday life as the building blocks of matter. As for the rest of hadrons – well, no one had any idea what they existed for (or “who ordered them,” as one researcher put it). There were so many of them that the influential physicist Wolfgang Pauli joked that physics was turning into botany. Physicists desperately needed to rein in the hadrons, to find the underlying principles that govern their behavior and would explain their maddening proliferation.*

**How messy and promiscuous are elementary particles? Are they like life where the boundaries kind of blur if you smush them together?

*This brings up an important point: there are many objects in nature whose symmetries are approximate. A real-life table is not perfectly round or perfectly square, a live butterfly has an asymmetry between its front and back, and a human body is not fully symmetrical. However, even in this case it turns out to be useful to consider their abstract, idealized versions, or models – a perfectly round table or an image of the butterfly in which we don’t distinguish between the front and the back. We then explore the symmetries of these idealized objects and adjust whatever inferences we can make from this analysis to account for the difference between a real-life object and its model.*

**Why do we just accept that the model isn't reality? Is there math that can describe reality with 100% fidelity?

*I’d like to point out some of the basic qualities of the abstract theory of symmetry because this is a good illustration of why mathematics is important.
The first is universality. The circle group is not only the group of symmetries of a round table, but also of all other round objects, like a glass, a bottle, a column, and so forth. In fact, to say that a given object is round is the same as to say that its group of symmetries is the circle group. This is a powerful statement: we realize that we can describe an important attribute of an object (“being round”) by describing its symmetry group (the circle). Likewise, “being square” means that the group of symmetries is the group of four elements described above. In other words, the same abstract mathematical object (such as the circle group) serves many different concrete objects, and it points to universal properties that they all have in common (such as roundness).*

**Is the circle group the only group that's infinitely symmetrical?  Circles play a powerful conceptual role for us in many artistic expressions.

*What motivated Gell-Mann and Zweig to predict the existence of quarks? Mathematical theory of representations of the group SU(3). Specifically, the fact that the group SU(3) has two different 3-dimensional representations. (Actually, that’s the reason there is a “3” in this group’s name.) Gell-Mann and Zweig suggested that these two representations should describe two families of fundamental particles: 3 quarks and 3 anti-quarks. It turns out that the 8- and 10-dimensional representations of SU(3) can be built from the 3-dimensional ones. And this gives us a precise blueprint for how to construct hadrons from quarks – just like in Lego.*

**Is there a point to them being structured like this? Could it have been any other way? Should we model the same symmetries if we want to simulate the universe?

*The discovery of quarks is a good example of the paramount role played by mathematics in science that we discussed in the Preface. These particles were predicted not on the basis of empirical data, but on the basis of mathematical symmetry patterns. This was a purely theoretical prediction, made within the framework of a sophisticated mathematical theory of representations of the  group SU(3). It took physicists years to master this theory (and in fact there was some resistance to it at first), but it is now the bread and butter of elementary particle physics. Not only did it provide a classification of hadrons, it also led to the discovery of quarks, which forever changed our understanding of physical reality.*

**Have we understood that group completely or is it possible to dig deeper? If we can't, can we be certain that we've found the smallest components?

*The fourth quality is relevance of mathematics to the physical world. For example, a lot of progress has been made in quantum physics in the past fifty years because of the application of the concept of symmetry to elementary particles and interactions between them. From this point of view, a particle, such as an electron or a quark, is like a round table or a snowflake, and its behavior is very much determined by its symmetries. (Some of these symmetries are exact, and some are approximate.)*

**Universality,  objectivity, endurance and relevance together makes math powerful.

*The mathematical theory of links and knots is used in biology: for example, to study bindings of DNA and enzymes.9 We view a DNA molecule as one thread, and the enzyme molecule as another thread. It turns out that when they bind together, highly non-trivial knotting between them may occur, which may alter the DNA. The way they entangle is therefore of great importance. It turns out that the mathematical study of the resulting links sheds new light on the mechanisms of recombination of DNA.*

**In a sense we're not discovering math, we're exploring how reality actually behaves and then we slap neat notation on it. At the absolute base layer, how could behaviors be described by anything purer?

*Gelfand ran his seminar in the most authoritarian way. He decided its every aspect, and though to an untrained eye his seminars could appear chaotic and disorganized, he actually devoted an enormous amount of time and energy to the preparation and choreographing of the weekly meetings.
Three years later, when Gelfand asked me to speak about my work, I had the opportunity to see the inner workings of the seminar up close. For now, I was observing it from the vantage point of a seventeen-year-old student just starting his mathematical career.
The seminar was in many ways the theater of a single actor. Officially, there would be a designated speaker reporting on a designated topic, but typically only part of the seminar would be devoted to it. Gelfand would usually bring up other topics and call other mathematicians, who had not been asked to prepare in advance, to the blackboard to explain them. But he was always at the center of it all. He and only he controlled the flow of the seminar and had the absolute power to interrupt the speaker at any moment with questions, suggestions, and remarks. I can still hear him say “Dayte opredelenie” – “Give the definition” – his frequent admonition to a speaker.
He also had the habit of launching into long tirades on various topics (sometimes unrelated to the material discussed), telling jokes, anecdotes, and stories of all kinds, many of them quite entertaining. This was where I heard the parable that I mentioned in the Preface: a drunkard may not know which number is larger, 2/3 or 3/5, but he knows that 2 bottles of vodka for 3 people is better than 3 bottles of vodka for 5 people. One of Gelfand’s skills was his ability to “rephrase” questions asked by others in such a way that the answer became obvious.*

**How do you maximize the surge of intelligence from a group gathering? It's hard to not feel that you're dictating and dumbing down the conversation when you're hands on leading it.

*In the subject that was becoming increasingly fractured and specialized, he was one of the last remaining Renaissance men able to bridge different areas. He epitomized the unity of mathematics. Unlike most seminars, which focus on one area of math, if you came to Gelfand’s seminar, you could see how all these different parts fit together. That’s why all of us gathered every Monday night on the fourteenth floor of the main MGU building and eagerly awaited the word of the master.*

**Bridging gaps can only come from a deeper more timeless source.

*The Shimura–Taniyama–Weil conjecture is a statement about certain equations. A large part of mathematics is in fact about solving equations. We want to know whether a given equation has a solution in a given domain; if so, can we find one? If there are several solutions, then how many? Why do some equations have solutions and some don’t?*

**What kind of equations are relevant when it comes to product development? Anything related to network theory ought to be interesting.

*Fibonacci numbers are ubiquitous in nature: from petal arrangements in flowers to the patterns on the surface of a pineapple. They also have many applications, such as the “Fibonacci retracement” in the technical analysis of stock trading.*

**I wonder if nature has a preference for recursive functions that can be solved linearly. The recursion makes it fractal which makes it extremely space effective, and the linear solution to it makes it energy efficient.

*This one line is a secret code containing all information about the numbers of solutions of the cubic equation modulo all primes.
A useful analogy would be to think of the cubic equation like a sophisticated biological organism, and its solutions as various traits of this organism. We know that all of these traits are encoded in the DNA molecule. Likewise, all the complexity of our cubic equation turns out to be encoded in a generating function, which is like the DNA of this equation. Furthermore, this function is defined by a simple rule.*

**Why do numbers relate to each other in strange ways? It's because we're looking at them as islands, and what we get confused about is the ocean. Remove the ocean and you'll see how the islands are connected.

*One might also ask whether, in addition to possessing innate beauty and establishing a surprising link between areas of mathematics that seem to be far removed from each other, this result has any practical applications. This is a fair question. At present, I am not aware of any. But cubic equations over finite fields of p elements of the kind we have considered above (which give rise to the so-called elliptic curves) are widely used in cryptography.14 So I would not be surprised if the analogues of Eichler’s result will also one day find applications as powerful and ubiquitous as encryption algorithms.*

**Applications are what makes it interesting to me. I have a real world problem and by using math I can understand it more precisely.

*This is really a question about the nature of mathematical insight. The ability to see patterns and connections that no one had seen before does not come easily. It is usually the product of months, if not years, of hard work. Little by little, the inkling of a new phenomenon or a theory emerges, and at first you don’t believe it yourself. But then you say: “what if it’s true?” You try to test the idea by doing sample calculations. Sometimes these calculations are hard, and you have to navigate through mountains of heavy formulas. The probability of making a mistake is very high, and if it does not work at first, you try to redo it, over and over again.
More often than not, at the end of the day (or a month, or a year), you realize that your initial idea was wrong, and you have to try something else. These are the moments of frustration and despair. You feel that you have wasted an enormous amount of time, with nothing to show for it. This is hard to stomach. But you can never give up. You go back to the drawing board, you analyze more data, you learn from your previous mistakes, you try to come up with a better idea. And every once in a while, suddenly, your idea starts to work. It’s as if you had spent a fruitless day surfing, when you finally catch a wave: you try to hold on to it and ride it for as long as possible. At moments like this, you have to free your imagination and let the wave take you as far as it can. Even if the idea sounds totally crazy at first.*

**How much pruning does our imagination and intuition do for us? How feasible would it be to have a bruteforce algorithm that simply tests every conceivable pattern? Could be guides by humans, but all mechanical calculations automated. Coming up with conjectures and then finding all patterns related to it and trying to tetris it together.

*I’ve always wondered: what did it take for him to come to believe that this wasn’t crazy, but real? To have the courage to say it publicly?*

**That's what makes mathematics confusing at times, things are thrown in there with no good explanation for why it's there other than that it's needed for it to work. Of course I lack a whole bunch of basic knowledge.

*As we noted earlier, when we talk about solutions of such an equation, it is important to specify to what numerical system they belong. There are many choices, and different choices give rise to different mathematical theories.
 In the previous chapter, we discussed solutions modulo prime numbers, and that’s one theory. But we can also look for solutions in complex numbers. That’s another theory, which yields Riemann surfaces.*

**Algebra is so much more flexible than it's taught. The concept of a variable is generally applicable to any type of templated problem-solving.

*A remarkable fact is that the set of all such solutions turns out to be exactly the set of points of a torus depicted earlier. In other words, each point of the torus can be assigned to one and only one pair of complex numbers x, y solving the above cubic equation, and vice versa.6*

**Geometric representations always feel safer for some reason.

*Another, more efficient way to imagine a fourth dimension is to think of a four-dimensional object as a collection of its three-dimensional “slices.” This would be similar to slicing a loaf of bread, which is three-dimensional, into slices so thin that we could think of them as being two-dimensional.*

**I wonder if this is how Cixin Liu conceptualized it in Three body Problem.

*Now that I’ve had students of my own, I appreciate even more what Borya has done for me (and what Evgeny Evgenievich and Fuchs did for me earlier). It’s hard work being a teacher! I guess in many ways it’s like having children. You have to sacrifice a lot, not asking for anything in return. Of course, the rewards can also be tremendous. But how do you decide in which direction to point students, when to give them a helping hand and when to throw them in deep waters and let them learn to swim on their own? This is art. No one can teach you how to do this.*

*But working on these projects, I gradually came to realize that we mathematicians are most useful for doctors not so much because of our knowledge of these statistical programs (after all, this isn’t by itself very difficult, and anyone can learn it), but because of our ability to formulate the right questions and then to go through a cold and unbiased analysis to get the answers. It is really this “mathematical mindset” that seems to be most useful to those who are not trained to think as mathematicians.*

**With skills in abstraction you gain the ability to see the essentials of every problem.

*After a couple dozen cases, I could already make the diagnosis myself, following the simple set of rules that I learned while interrogating him. After half a dozen more, I was practically as good as he was in predicting the outcome. There was in fact a simple algorithm at play that Sergei was following in most cases.*

**As a human to be able to quickly copy someone else's decision-making algorithm tells us that AI is bound to take over that job.

*When he explained things to you, he did not try to do it in a self-aggrandizing way, as if he was unveiling a big mystery which you would never be able to fully understand on your own (which unfortunately is the case for some of our colleagues, who shall remain nameless). On the contrary, he was always able to put things in the simplest and clearest possible way, so after he explained something to you, you felt like you’d known it all along.*

**The clarity with which you're able to express things says a lot about the inner workings of your mind.
