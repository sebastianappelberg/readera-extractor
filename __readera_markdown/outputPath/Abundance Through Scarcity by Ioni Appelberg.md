*I suspect it might have something to do with the nature of this thing and how it shows us that we’re all connected. As Ioni often points out, studying bitcoin is akin to discovering deep med-itation or psychedelics - it opens up new pathways in our brains.
It lets us see that everything is way more connected than it seems.*

**The religious spirit manifests itself in many different ways, though the substrate in which it manifests share commonalities. Is there a Turing completeness property of meme complexes, where beyond a certain threshold the religious spirit can take hold? Religious spirit in this case defined as being able to see the world beyond yourself, as connected, as infinite and empty at the same time.

*A striking 90% of the govern-ment’s expenses were devoted to its military, driving the empire to continuously expand its capabilities — and its costs. Eventually, the Romans stretched their territory and military ambitions beyond their socioeconomic limits, triggering repeated f i scal crises and cre-ating a vicious cycle of costs and strain.*

**It's surprising that it lasted so long. 

---
Page: 39

*To f i nance these expenses, Nero debased the Roman currency by reducing the silver content in the denarius.*

**This is effectively a transfer of wealth from current holders of the currency to the controllers of the supply. Current holders should be able to remint their current holdings and effectively gain more coins but they probably weren't allowed. It's an instant way to raise taxes, eventually the holders become so poor they can't live a good life.

*Populations shrink, and only a few distinct occupations such as farmers, artisans, and merchants persist. T h is decline also triggers the loss of knowledge, technology, culture, and literature, corroding the ability to read, write, and calculate. T h e fall of Rome in the f i fth century CE serves as a haunting reminder of the fragility of even the most advanced and formidable empires.*

**I wonder if we have extracted so much complexity out into code and machines that the complexity is becoming more and more decoupled from humans. We might get to a stage where we fall but our machine predecessors carry on.

*With the current trend of failing institutions and declining populations, today’s civilization may not survive long enough to see the second half of this millennium. We are now at a critical juncture, with our decline potentially progressing toward a singularity crisis of our own, where the fate of our species would be irrevocably altered forever.*

**Isn't it good to start from scratch sometimes? Schmactenberger argues that globalization has made it so that we go extinct if we fail this time. Starting from scratch still stands though and that's the primary benefit of Balaji's network state concept.

*When pondering the Fermi Paradox, we must remember that the answer, at least partially, may be found right here at home. T h e rise and fall of human civilizations may, in fact, hold the key to unlocking the enigma of cosmic silence. In the ruins of forsaken cities and the shadows of once-great civilizations, might hold the answers to why the cosmos is silent.*

**Repetition from above.

Page: 62

*Moreover, individual cities are no longer the sole entities at risk of crumbling in the face of societal decline and 45 A B U N D A N C E T H R O U G H S C A R C I T Y economic implosion; our globally interconnected civilization forms a precarious chain of dominoes. Should the economy collapse or resources dwindle, the entire civilization could totter on the brink of total collapse. When resources diminish, or the value of money erodes, the very foundations of our civilization tremble, compelling us to confront the transient nature of our societal constructs.*

**Countries may be fast enough to isolate themselves, and by doing so the world again becomes decentralized and less fragile.

*T h roughout history, humanity has progressed steadily in the economic realm, punctuated by rare, extraordinary opportunities that catapult progress onto near-vertical trajectories. We stand at the precipice of such a pivotal moment once more, the f i rst in four centuries. T h e shift toward a bitcoin-based economy heralds the po-tential for unprecedented genesis and preservation of wealth. As this transition unfolds, future generations will regard the twenty-f i rst century as an epoch of transformative change, echoing the im-pact of the Age of Discovery of the f i fteenth and sixteenth centuries, and marking the dawn of a new era of economic and technological prosperity.*

**We might very well be at the end of a one of those transformative periods. The truly useful ideas will be rediscovered in the next transformative period, and there they will get the benefit of starting from scratch.

*Today, we possess the technology to devalue our cur-rencies at a much faster pace, hinting at a potential downfall swifter than that of the Romans.*

**Maybe that's a good thing, since it'll allow us to iterate faster on civilizations.

*Enter Satoshi, our twenty-f i rst-century Morpheus. His invita-tion wasn’t a red pill, but an orange one, leading us toward the boundless horizon of life, liberty, and love. T h is journey takes us be-yond the blinding veil of the f i at derangement syndrome, revealing a world untainted by societal constraints. But unlike Neo, we can-not expect the world’s source code to materialize before our eyes.
Instead, bitcoin becomes our lens, illuminating the fabric of our minds and the foundations of society with the light of truth, hon-esty, and spiritual enlightenment. It uncovers the f i at system for what it truly is: mandatory malware that infects not only our soci-ety but also our thoughts, actions, and wellbeing.*

**I'm not sure that what's described is essential to a fiat economy specifically. I think it's fundamental to a labor driven economy. What could save us from that is knowledge, something that allows us to automate, etc.

*Mathematics proved to be the elo-quent syntax that threads through the fabric of the uni-verse. Mathematics has been our compass, guiding us to chart the cosmos, sculpt civilizations, devise advanced technology, and de-scribe the natural world.*

**Any language is necessarily a stripped down version of reality. Why is that? Is it because it's only touching a few of our senses? Sometimes words can give us feelings and visions that reality can't.

---
Page: 126

*Elementaryparticleslikequarksandgluonsarenottheultimate constituents of the universe; the mathematical equations that de-scribe them are. T h is realization is as profound as it is perplexing:
the tangible reality we experience, from the smallest particles to the grandest galaxies, seems to emerge from the intangible realm of mathematics. And our current understanding of reality suggests that the universe possesses an unknown property that allows math-ematics to materialize into physical objects. T h e transformation of the abstract into the physical realm is, perhaps, the most awe-inspiring trick the universe ever pulled.*

**It's more that mathematics helps us describe what's there, but even mathematics is incredibly low resolution.

Page: 131

*T h e language of the universe wasn’t a gift from gods, aliens, or our mythical ancestors. Instead, our understanding of mathemat-ics has been hard-won through millennia of relentless human en-deavor. Our f i rst quantum leap? T h e seemingly simple concept of zero. T h is unassuming numeral ignited the fuse that propelled us from the hearth f i res of an agrarian society to the blazing glory of modern civilization. Before zero, humankind’s crowning achieve-ment was the humble ox-drawn plow.*

**This gives too much credit to the theoretical and not enough credit to the innovative efforts, just the pure grind.

*Another riveting difference lies in memory preservation. In the digital realm, memo-ries are retained effortlessly, transcending the boundaries of time, withpastandpresentmemoriesexhibitingthesamef i delity. Incon-trast, thephysicalworldexactsaheftytoll formemorypreservation.
With the discovery of the digital world, we have gained a collective, highly superior autobiographical memory, for better or worse.*

**It would be interesting to see how memory storage has evolved since the beginning. What was the first example of information preservation through time? Was it the first self-replicator? Could one call the laws of physics a sort of memory? Is memory necessary for accumulation of complexity?

*Even though we’re only at the dawn of this Digital Age, it already heralds unparalleled freedom.*

**Are we really just at the dawn of it and not in the middle? There will be something deeper than digital in a few decades.

*To accommodate the changes of the digital age, bitcoin has emerged as the new currency — a quantum leap in monetary tech-nology. Designed to cater to a digital, information-centric econ-omy, it moves faster than f i at, stores value better than gold, and is resistant to control, censorship, and conf i scation. It challenges tra-ditional notions about the state’s role in money and the necessity of inflation for economic growth, underscoring the truly transforma-tive power of en epoch shift.*

**How long will the state be with us? What replaces it?

*To create a digital monetary network that harnessed the scarcity of physical energy*

**I'd argue that it's not about energy per se, it just happens to be that energy is the limiting factor on computation. In the future where energy is free and abundant it might be physical space instead. 

---
Page: 155

*Yet, the true magnitude of bitcoin’s potential and its consequent impact on our world remains unknown. But bitcoin needs to be studied, not feared. Like any paradigm-altering discovery, bitcoin warrants holistic, honest, and objective research from both the natural and social sciences.*

**Branding might be the killer of Bitcoin, much like it was the killer of BitTorrent. Torrent technology is incredibly useful and fundamental to many things but it's still considered taboo.

*In every transaction, we exchange a portion of our past for the convenience of not having to spend our presenttimeonthetaskathand. Ultimately,thedesiretohavemore money is rooted in the desire to have more time. We work hard now to have more time later.*

**It's more that it stores work and value, and let's you trade 5 hours of shoe polishing for 1 hour of coding. Time is one thing money can buy, but things in general is what you're after.

*As we perceive our world today, only three elements in the uni-verse are absolutely scarce: mass, human time, and bitcoin. T h e f i rst two, we can’t be entirely sure of. Absolute scarcity is an as-tonishing, borderline otherworldly concept. It def i es comprehen-sion, and it bears repeating: Humankind has discovered bitcoin, a resource potentially as valuable and rare as time itself.*

**The argument would be more solid if you removed bitcoin from it.

*Across millennia, the nature of time has been the subject of profound debate. Is it linear or cyclical? Finite or inf i nite? Does it even exist?*

**Sometimes the repetitions are very differently phrased which makes me doubt if I understood it right the first time.

*Just as a flower provides nectar to a bee, bitcoin provides a monetary reward for people to harness energy and secure the blockchain, in a symbiotic relationship. And with this abundance of energy, bitcoin can afford to grow massive proverbial cryptographic antlers and gain dominion over all other forms of money.*

*h is groundbreaking trait guarantees bitcoin’s resilience, ensuring its survival in the face of technological ebbs and flows, much like our species has survived by continually evolving to become stronger and harder to extinguish.*

**It's still not proven whether humans are resilient. When we've outlived every other species, then we've proven ourselves. Sharks and crocodiles are far more successful than us in that sense.

*h e bitcoin network is a titan of computational power, un-matched in its capacity. Operating at an astounding rate of two hundred ExaHashes per second — equating to two hundred quintil-lion operations every second — this digital behemoth stands as the world’s most formidable supercomputer. T h ere is no close second.*

**Machine learning probably has more computation. 

---
Page: 204

*Yet, this ostensibly robust system is not devoid of critics. De-tractors argue that banks, governments, and corporations continue to cling to an analog relic from the 1400s, fraught with inherent vul-nerabilities. T h eir core concernis that those who controlthe records also wield the power to alter them, a capability that opens avenues for accounting fraud — a destructive force that has left its mark on industries, governments, and corporations over the past seven cen-turies.*

**It's actually quite easy to add immutability to this using a checksum or something.

*For thousands of years, this has remained the sole solution to transacting over distances, a testament to the complexities of trust.*

**It's more that it's a solution that's been good enough. But the stronger the 3rd parties get the worse the solution is.

Page: 205

*T h e transition from physical commodities to bitcoin marked a def i ning moment in the evolution of money. It is the equivalent of the f i rst amphibian crawling ashore, evolving into a warm-blooded, furry mammal, or the humble ape transforming into a sapient 188 RISING FROM THE ASHES human being — an apex predator capable of gazing at the stars, pondering its place in the cosmos.*

*T h roughout our history, the struggle for survival has often left little room for true innovation. However, as technology began to liberate us from this existence, the amount of time available to innovate increased massively.*

*h e production of economic goods has always relied on the com-bination of human knowledge, time, and labor. As AI and robotics inf i ltrate the workplace, however, a new era of time abundance dawns. Robots and AI are faster, more precise, vastly more capable in many regards, and less injury-prone than humans. T h ey demand less compensation, never unionize, and work tirelessly, 365 days a year. T h is will greatly expand our time abundance, allowing us to focus on our creative, intellectual, spiritual, and scientif i c passions, and even explore new ways of organizing society.*

**What if it turns out that biological life is the most resource efficient machine at gruntwork? Will the only jobs left for humans then be those? And the AI takes over all creative work.

*Much like how language serves as a mental scaffold, shaping our perception of the physical world, money, too, functions as a cognitive framework — a mental module influencing our time preference. Unlike language, money as a psychotechnology does not alter our perception of reality; rather, it grants the power to sway our contemplation, investment, and planning for the future. At its core, money orchestrates the delicate balance between prioritizing the present and the future.*

**I wonder how strong the influence actually is on individuals. To me, something like the monetary system would rather affect the system as a whole. We are consumers of the monetary system but we're not part of it, and it's not really a part of us. It's part of our collective.

---
Page: 293

*h e f i at monetary system, plagued by numerous drawbacks, di-rects its most insidious poison toward the corrosion of our time preference. Since f i at currencies wither quickly, they offer no means of safeguarding the future, engendering an unhealthy preoc-cupation with immediate gratif i cation. Bitcoin, on the other hand, stands as a bulwark against the ravages of time, mitigating future uncertainties and nurturing a forward-thinking mindset.*

**There are hundreds of ways for us to combat a high time preference. That just tells me that this is an additional bandaid. However, the disease is clever, once it's adapted to our defense it'll find a hole to sneak in through. Which will always happen until you get rid of the disease.

*Gold has an immense market capitalization of $10 trillion, but bitcoin’s potential transcends even this lofty benchmark. If bitcoin were to match gold’s market cap, each coin would be valued at an astonishing $500,000. But bitcoin’s potential goes far beyond a mere half a million dollars per coin.*

**Before we got off the gold standard its market cap had to be bigger.

*Conformity became essential for survival;
318 TO ETERNITY AND BEYOND challenging established practices and norms risked famine and disaster. T h is adherence to tradition solidif i ed our values and attitudes, altering the very essence of what it meant to be human.*

**With numbers and with tragedy of the commons tropes we are bound to a certain level of conformity. Of course if the relative amount of resources per person or group increased we might be free.

*h e comforts and conveniences of modern civilized living entice us, but often leave us feeling unfulf i lled and longing for something that we have lost — much like our ancestors must have felt during theAgeofAgriculture. Forallitsmaterialadvantages, thesedentary life has left us edgy, unfulf i lled.Even after 400 generations in villages and cities, we remember. T h e open road still softly calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood.*

**I wonder how the animals at the zoo feels.

*Now, for the f i rst time in 12,000 years, we possess the resources, wealth, and cultural and technological maturity to break free from the constraints of agricultural attitudes and rediscover our ancient ways of being — a modern setting. We are f i nally presented with the opportunity to live in harmony with our innate inclinations and reclaim our humanity.*

**It's not like agriculture has disappeared, it has just moved deeper down the stack of civilization.

*Perhaps the most crucial function of bitcoin is this: In times of decline, it offers a safety net for all future civilizations. Its im-munity to debasement ensures that societies can maintain the nec-essary coordination and resources to persevere through adversity, preventing the downward spirals that doomed empires like Rome.*

**What if it just causes things to crash faster? And that might be a good thing, making the impact smaller.

---
Page: 345

*In the midst of a fractured economy, bitcoin emerges like a phoenix from the ashes of decline. Unlike the f i at system, bitcoin’s mathematically f i xed supply does not allow us to resort to currency debasement in times of crises. Instead, it carves a path toward a post-scarcity civilization, an automated society with abundant energy, by instilling in us a low time preference and offering f i nancial incentives to build for the future.*

**Bitcoin does not have any features that deal with winner takes all dynamics. It seems to me that it'll lead to an undisruptable oligarchy. The problem with money is not inflation, the problem is that money is the dictator of our freedom.

*Certain technologies, like brief yet brilliant comets, flash across the canvas of human history. T h ey serve their purpose, illuminating our path for a time, only to recede into the annals of progress.
T h ink of the printing press, the telegraph, or paper currency; these innovations were stepping stones, each one paving the way for the next invention, never intended to be here forever. Bitcoin is not one of those technologies. Bitcoin is not just a rocket booster designed to propel humanity skyward, only to fall off once it has brought our civilization to a certain altitude.*

**Why not?

---
Page: 345

*Bitcoin signif i es a paradigm shift, a fundamental evolution in our conception of money. Bitcoin isn’t just another stepping stone orrocketboosterdrivingourcivilizationforward—it’sf i nalmoney.
It’s the spacecraft itself. Engineered to weather the ebbs and flows of civilization and the vicissitudes of time, bitcoin is destined to be our unwavering companion for millennia to come.*

*Finally, a profound thank you to Satoshi Nakamoto. Your groundbreaking discovery of absolute mathematical scarcity has not only altered the trajectory of human civilization but also in-stilled in me a fervor that borders on the psychotic for the future of our species.*
