*In our struggle to communicate such a complex network of concepts and ideas within the linear constraints of written language, we felt that it would help to interconnect the text by a network of cross-references.*

**A new form of language is close to emerging. Hyperlinks is just the start of it. We will find a way to make the nonlinear easy to explain and communicate.

*The modern meaning of science is that of an organized body of knowledge acquired through a particular method known as the scientif i c method. This modern understanding evolved gradually during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The characteristics of the scientif i c method were fully recognized only in the twentieth century and are still frequently misunderstood, especially by nonscientists.*

**I thought it was much older than that, but it makes sense I suppose. The fact that we still haven't perfected it is a sign of immaturity.

*What makes the scientif i c enterprise feasible is the realization that, although science can never provide complete and def i nitive explanations, limited and approximate scientif i c knowledge is possible. This may sound frustrating, but for many scientists the fact that we can formulate approximate models and theories to describe an endless web of interconnected phenomena, and that we are able to systematically improve our models or approximations over time, is a source of conf i dence and strength.*

**It's crucial to embrace that all models and conceptions are approximations of reality. What we want is to improve that approximation to the degree where it's in practice indistinguishable from reality.

*Kuhn's work has had an enormous impact on the philosophy of science, as well as on the social sciences.
Perhaps the most important aspect of his def i nition of a scientif i c paradigm is the fact that it includes not only concepts and techniques but also values. According to Kuhn, values are not peripheral to science, nor to its applications to technology, but constitute their very basis and driving force.*

**Values have great leverage on the final results of a method or a framework since they're at the foundation.

*The emerging new scientif i c conception of life, which we summarized in our Preface, can be seen as part of a broader paradigm shift from a mechanistic to a holistic and ecological worldview. At its very core we fi nd a shift of metaphors that is now becoming ever more apparent, as discussed by Capra (2002) – a change from seeing the world as a machine to understanding it as a network.*

**Can this thinking be applied to programming too? Taking programs from being mechanistic to organic?

*It has not been a steady change, but has involved scientif i c revolutions, backlashes, and pendulum swings. A chaotic pendulum in the sense of chaos theory (discussed in Chapter 6) – oscillations that almost repeat themselves but not quite, seemingly random and yet forming a complex, highly organized pattern – would perhaps be the most appropriate contemporary metaphor.*

**Good metaphors are extremely powerful for creating intuition.

*The study of matter begins with the question, “What is it made of?” This leads to the notions of fundamental elements, building blocks; to measuring and quantifying.
The study of form asks, “What is the pattern?” And that leads to the notions of order, organization, and relationships. Instead of quantity, it involves quality; instead of measuring, it involves mapping.
These are two very dif f erent lines of investigation that have been in competition with one another throughout our scientif i c and philosophical tradition. For most of the time, the study of matter – of quantities and constituents – has dominated. But every now and then the study of form – of patterns and relationships – came to the fore.*

**Substance VS pattern. Matter VS form.

*Aquinas taught that there could be no conf l ict between faith and reason, because the two books on which they were based – the Bible and the “book of nature” – were both authored by God. He produced a vast body of precise, detailed, and systematic philosophical writings, in which he integrated Aristotle's encyclopedic works and medieval Christian theology into a seamless whole.*

**Most interesting works are fusions of opposing elements.

*Many aspects of Leonardo's science are still Aristotelian, but what makes it sound so modern to us today is that his forms are living forms, continually shaped and transformed by underlying processes. Throughout his life he studied, drew, and painted the rocks and strata of the Earth, shaped by erosion; the growth of plants, shaped by their metabolism; and the anatomy of the animal body in motion.*

**We are verbs, not nouns. We're continually changing, we're dynamic agents embedded in dynamic systems.

*Care fl ows naturally if the “self” is widened and deepened so that protection of free Nature is felt and conceived as protection of ourselves…Just as we need no morals to make us breathe…[so] if your “self” in the wide sense embraces another being, you need no moral exhortation to show care…You care for yourself without feeling any moral pressure to do it.*

**Protecting something gets easier if you conceive of it as a part of yourself.

*Physics, together with chemistry, is essential to understand the behavior of the molecules in living cells, but it is not suf f i cient to describe their self-organizing patterns and processes.*

**It could in the sense that all systems are fractal, so the shapes that are going on at the high level are the same but bigger than the ones going on at the smaller level. Another thing that rubs me wrong is that, holistic thinking should be a superset of reductionist thinking, not get rid of it.

*The nature of medieval science was very dif f erent from that of our contemporary science. It was based on both reason and faith, and its main goal was to understand the meaning and signif i cance of things, rather than prediction and control. Medieval scientists, looking for the purposes underlying various natural phenomena, considered questions relating to God, the human soul, and ethics to be of the highest signif i cance.*

**Seeing how it was called the dark ages, is it really a way of thinking worth pursuing? It may be unfair to pin the fall of civilization on the scientific values of that time.

*Galileo's program of f ers us a dead world: Out go sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell, and along with them have since gone esthetic and ethical sensibility, values, quality, soul, consciousness, spirit. Experience as such is cast out of the realm of scientif i c discourse.
Hardly anything has changed our world more during the past four hundred years than Galileo's audacious program. We had to destroy the world in theory before we could destroy it in practice.*

**What are the drawbacks of a more organic view? Ascribing purpose where there is none. Dogma. Politics. What else?

*“This had not happened since Aristotle, and is a sign of the new self-conf i dence that resulted from the progress of science. There is a freshness about his work that is not to be found in any eminent previous philosopher since Plato.”*

**The pendulum swings become tighter and tighter. Will we get to see an original, paradigmatic thinker in our time? Someone that changes the way that every scientific field works.

*On the other hand, overemphasis on the Cartesian method has led to the fragmentation that is characteristic of both our general thinking and our academic disciplines, and to the widespread attitude of reductionism in science – the belief that all aspects of complex phenomena can be understood by reducing them to their smallest constituent parts. (As we have discussed, no scientif i c description of natural phenomena can be completely accurate and exhaustive. In other words, all scientif i c theories are reductionist in the sense that they need to reduce the phenomena described to a manageable number of characteristics. However, science does not need not be reductionist in the Cartesian sense of reducing phenomena to their smallest constituents.)*

**Holistic thinking is better expressed as algorithms, patterns, rules, processes, principles and so on. They are more like a garden than an equation.

*The image of the earth as a living organism and nurturing mother served as a cultural constraint restricting the actions of human beings. One does not readily slay a mother, dig into her entrails for gold, or mutilate her body…As long as the earth was considered to be alive and sensitive, it could be considered a breach of human ethical behavior to carry out destructive acts against it.*

**This reminds me of the way we reduced our animal companions to slaves.

*Plants and animals were considered simply machines; human beings were inhabited by a rational soul, but as far as the human body was concerned, it was indistinguishable from an animal-machine. Descartes explained at great length how the motions and various biological functions of the body could be reduced to mechanical operations, in order to show that living organisms were nothing but automata.*

**We may not be more than automata but we're complex such beings and the complexity is in the software. The consciousness of creatures is what imbues them with a higher level ghost that animates them.

*Newton developed a comprehensive mathematical formulation of the mechanistic view of nature, and thus accomplished a grand synthesis of the works of Copernicus and Kepler, Bacon, Galileo, and Descartes.*

**Who will turn out to be the forefathers of true AGI? I like Jeff Hawkins, Michael Levin, Stephen Wolphram and Joscha Bach.

*The philosophical basis of this secularization of nature was the Cartesian division between mind and matter. As a consequence of this division, the world was believed to be a mechanical system that could be described objectively, without ever mentioning the human observer. In particular, human values were separated from scientif i c facts, and scientists henceforth tended to believe that scientif i c facts are independent of our values. Such an objective description of nature became the ideal of all science, an ideal that was maintained until the twentieth century when the fallacy of the belief in a value-free science was exposed, as we have discussed.*

**Scooping facts under the rug prevents us from getting closer to the truth. How can we discard the first person experience? It should be considered just another perspective. The flaws we error correct.

*Thus Newtonian mechanics was extended far beyond the description of macroscopic bodies. The behaviors of solids, liquids, and gases, including the phenomena of heat and sound, were explained successfully in terms of the motion of elementary material particles. For the scientists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries this tremendous success of the mechanistic model conf i rmed their belief that the universe was indeed a huge mechanical system, running according to the Newtonian laws of motion, and that Newton's mechanics was the ultimate theory of natural phenomena.*

**Having something like this for complexity would be really handy.

*Lamarck, probably the greatest biologist in history, turned that ladder of explanation upside down. He was the man who said it starts with the infusoria and that there were changes leading up to man. His turning the taxonomy upside down is one of the most astonishing feats that has ever happened. It was the equivalent in biology of the Copernican revolution in astronomy.*

**Revolutionaries turn the world on its head in many different ways.

*According to the second law, any isolated physical system will proceed spontaneously in the direction of ever-increasing disorder. T o express this direction in the evolution of physical systems in precise mathematical form, physicists introduced a new quantity called “entropy,” which measures the degree of disorder, and hence the degree of evolution of a physical system. According to classical thermodynamics, the entropy, or disorder, of the universe as a whole keeps increasing. The entire world-machine is running down and will eventually grind to a halt.
This grim picture of cosmic evolution is evidently in sharp contrast to the evolutionary idea held by biologists.*

**Aren't you forgetting that this egg did not exist before? It was put together in the womb of a chicken. What if the increasing order given by life starts to outpace the increasing entropy?

*In Descartes’ mechanistic conception of the world, all of nature works according to mechanical laws, and everything in the material world can be explained in terms of the arrangement and movements of its parts. This implies that one should be able to understand all aspects of complex structures – plants, animals, or the human body – by reducing them to their smallest constituent parts. This philosophical position is known as Cartesian reductionism.
The fallacy of the reductionist view lies in the fact that, while there is nothing wrong in saying that the structures of all living organisms are composed of smaller parts, and ultimately of molecules, this does not imply that their properties can be explained in terms of molecules alone.
As we discuss in Section 4.3, the essential properties of a living system are emergent properties – properties that are not found in any of the parts but emerge at the level of the system as a whole. These emergent properties arise from specif i c patterns of organization – that is, from conf i gurations of ordered relationships among the parts.
This is the central insight of the systems view of life.*

**You will not be able to explain consciousness without a proper understanding emerging properties.

*These developments raised physiology to a new level of sophistication. The simplistic mechanical models of living organisms were abandoned, but the essence of the Cartesian idea survived. Animals were still machines, although they were much more complicated than mechanical clockworks, as they involved chemical and electrical phenomena. Thus biology ceased to be Cartesian in the sense of Descartes’ strictly mechanical image of living organisms, but it remained Cartesian in the wider sense of attempting to reduce all aspects of living organisms to the physical and chemical interactions of their smallest constituents.*

**I truly believe that this has held back life sciences more than anything else. I hope that Michael Levin breaks through with his complexity respecting theories.

*Darwin's discovery that all forms of life have descended from a common ancestor by a long process of modif i cations over billions of years introduced a radical shift in biological thought – a change of perspective from being to becoming. Moreover, by realizing that all living organisms are related by common ancestry, the Darwinian conception of life was utterly holistic and systemic: a vast planetary network of living beings interlinked in space and time.*

**Did this put us on a path back to respecting other life forms?

*During the decades following the discovery of the genetic code, genetic determinism became the dominant paradigm in molecular biology, generating a host of powerful metaphors. DNA was often referred to as the organism's genetic “program” or “blueprint,” and the genetic code as the universal “language of life.” The exclusive focus on genes implied by these metaphors largely eclipsed the organism from the biologists’ view. Living organisms tended to be viewed simply as collections of genes, subject to random mutations and selective forces in the environment over which they have no control.*

**I wonder how much of the solution space gets constrained by convincing metaphors. And I wonder what its impact is on the time to truth.

*These mechanisms are studied from the point of view of cellular and molecular biology, leaving out all inf l uences of nonbiological circumstances on biological processes. Out of the large network of phenomena that inf l uence health, the biomedical approach studies only a few physiological aspects. Knowledge of these aspects is, of course, very useful, but they represent only a small part of the story. Medical practice based on such a limited approach is not very ef f ective in promoting and maintaining good health. This will not change until medical science relates its study of the biological aspects of illness to the general physical and psychological condition of the human organism and its environment.*

**It's so fucking apparent that what doctors do don't solve any kind of root cause of the issues. They alleviate symptoms with drugs that cause other issues. Surgery is the exception.

*As the atoms in a gas would establish a balanced state, so human individuals would settle down in society in a “state of nature.” Thus the function of government was not to impose its own laws on the people, but rather to discover and enforce the natural laws that existed before any government was formed.
According to Locke, these natural laws included the freedom and equality of all individuals as well as the right to property, which represented the fruits of one's labor.*

**There's a certain truth to it. Left to their own devices humans create societies that operate very similar in some ways. Although of course very differently in the details. For example,  most societies have laws but the laws can differ quite a bit. What's interesting is that those details feeds back to other behavior which makes the final outcomes radically different. Where women can't vote, certain technologies just won't be invented. New technology, technical or social, changes the way the society operates.

*This idea of a worldly calling projected religious behavior into the secular world. It was emphasized even more forcefully by the Puritan sects, which saw worldly activity and the material rewards resulting from industrious behavior as a sign of divine predestination. Thus arose the famous Protestant “work ethic,” in which hard, self-denying work and worldly success were equated with virtue. On the other hand, the Puritans abhorred all but the most frugal consumption, and consequently the accumulation of wealth was sanctioned, as long as it was combined with an industrious career. In Weber's theory these religious values and motives provided the essential emotional drive and energy for the rise and rapid development of capitalism.*

**It's a religion with a weak foundation, which might be a good thing. It's already starting to crack, what we might see after is hopefully for the better.

*Smith lived at a time when the Industrial Revolution had begun to change the face of Britain. When he wrote The Wealth of Nations the transition from an agrarian, handicraft economy to one dominated by steam power and by machines operated in large factories and mills was well under way. The spinning jenny had been invented and machine looms were used in cotton factories employing up to 300 workers. The new private enterprise, factories, and power-driven machinery shaped Smith's ideas to such an extent that he enthusiastically advocated the social transformation of his time and criticized the remnants of the land-based feudal system.*

**Did he see the logical conclusion of a technological civilization? Did he see the exponential development that was around the corner?

*This idealistic picture underlies the “competitive model” widely used by economists today. Its basic assumptions include perfect and free information for all participants in a market transaction; the belief that each buyer and seller in a market is small and has no inf l uence on price; and the complete and instant mobility of displaced workers, natural resources, and machinery. All these conditions are violated in the vast majority of today's markets, yet most economists continue to use them as the basis of their theories.*

**Friction and slowness makes reality harder to predict.

*Marx recognized that capitalist forms of social organization would speed the process of technological innovation and increase material productivity, and he predicted that this, “dialectically” (i.e., by changing into its opposite), would change social relationships. Thus he was able to foresee phenomena like monopolies and depressions, and to predict that capitalism would foster socialism – as it did – and that it would, eventually, disappear – as it may.*

**It would have been very meta if he'd included, in his own analysis, the impact of his own work on the growth of socialism.

*In the twentieth century the Keynesian model became thoroughly assimilated into the mainstream of economic thought. Most economists have remained uninterested in the political problem of unemployment, and instead have continued their attempts to “f i ne-tune” the economy by applying the Keynesian remedies of printing money, raising or lowering interest rates, cutting or increasing taxes, and so on. However, these methods ignore the detailed structure of the economy and the qualitative nature of its problems, and hence their successes are very limited.
The fl aws of Keynesian economics have now become evident. The Keynesian model is inadequate because it ignores so many factors that are crucial to understanding the economic situation in the twenty-f i rst century. It concentrates on the domestic economy, dissociating it from the global economic networks and disregarding international economic agreements; it neglects the overwhelming political power of today's global corporations, pays no attention to political conditions, and ignores the social and environmental costs of economic activities. At best the Keynesian approach can provide a set of possible scenarios but cannot make specif i c predictions. Like most of Cartesian economic thought, it has outlived its usefulness.*

**Not only Bitcoiners shit on Keynes.

*Economists generally fail to recognize that the economy is merely one aspect of the whole ecological and social fabric.
They neglect this social and ecological interdependence, treating all goods equally without considering the many ways in which these goods are related to the rest of the world, and reducing all values to the single criterion of private prof i t making.*

**Money on money return, a tree is worth more dead than alive.
