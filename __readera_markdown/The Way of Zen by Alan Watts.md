*But the scienti?cally trained Westerner is, not without reason, a cautious and skeptical fellow who likes to know what he is “getting into.” He is acutely conscious of the capacity of the mind for self-deception, for going into places where entrance is impossible without leaving one’s critical perspective at the door. Asians tend so much to despise this attitude, and their Western devotees even more so, that they neglect to tell the scienti?c inquirer many things that are still well within the possibilities of human speech and intellectual understanding.*

**Being intentionally obscure is just immature.

*The reason why Taoism and Zen present, at ?rst sight, such a puzzle to the Western mind is that we have taken a restricted view of human knowledge. For us, almost all knowledge is what a Taoist would call conventional knowledge, because we do not feel that we really know anything unless we can represent it to ourselves in words, or in some other system of conventional signs such as the notations of mathematics or music. Such knowledge is called conventional because it is a matter of social agreement as to the codes of communication. Just as people speaking the same language have tacit agreements as to what words shall stand for what things, so the members of every society and every culture are agreement as to the classi?cation and valuation of actions and things.*

**It's not necessarily true that western philosophies requires clear cut answers to things. The concept of Aporia was fundamental to Socrates, being in a state of not knowing what you know anymore.

*Once again, it is easy to see the conventional character of roles.
For a man who is a father may also be a doctor and an artist, as well as an employee and a brother. And it is obvious that even the sum total of these role labels will be far from supplying an adequate description of the man himself, even though it may place him in certain general classi?cations. But the conventions which govern human identity are more subtle and much less obvious than these. We learn, very thoroughly though far less explicitly, to identify ourselves with an equally conventional view of “myself.”
For the conventional “self” or “person” is composed mainly of a history consisting of selected memories, and beginning from the moment of parturition. According to convention, I am not simply what I am doing now. I am also what I have done, and my conventionally edited version of my past is made to seem almost more the real “me” than what I am at this moment. For what I am seems so fleeting and intangible, but what I was is ?xed and ?nal. It is the ?rm basis for predictions of what I will be in the future, and so it comes about that I am more closely identi?ed with what no longer exists than with what actually is!*

**Labels and roles are not rich enough to describe anyone. And viewing a person as a static thing has very limited use.

*Abstraction is thus almost a necessity for communication, since it enables us to represent our experiences with simple and rapidly made “grasps” of the mind. When we say that we can think only of one thing at a time, this is like saying that the Paci?c Ocean cannot be swallowed at a gulp. It has to be taken in a cup, and downed bit by bit. Abstractions and conventional signs are like the cup; they reduce experience to units simple enough to be comprehended one at a time. In a similar way, curves are measured by reducing them to a sequence of tiny straight lines, or by thinking of them in terms of the squares which they cross when plotted on graph paper.*

**Consciousness is not the limiting valve of understanding and experience but rather awareness and language is. We can be in a state that makes no simple abstractions and distinctions between what we perceive, a state where everything is intertwined and part of the same stuff.

*Other examples of the same process are the newspaper photograph and the transmission of television. In the former, a natural scene is reproduced in terms of light and heavy dots arranged in a screen or gridlike pattern so as to give the general impression of a black-and-white photograph when seen without a magnifying glass. Much as it may look like the original scene, it is only a reconstruction of the scene in terms of dots, somewhat as our conventional words and thoughts are reconstructions of experience in terms of abstract signs. Even more like the thought process, the television camera transmits a natural scene in terms of a linear series of impulses which may be passed along a wire.*

**It's natural for us to notice that these things are less rich than the reality they're portraying. Good art is a lossless compression scheme of the concepts it's portraying. Is art able to even go beyond the richness of reality? I wouldn't be able to know, I'm too far abstracted from it.

*There is, then, an analogy–and perhaps more than mere analogy– between central vision and conscious, one-at-a-time thinking, and between peripheral vision and the rather mysterious process which enables us to regulate the incredible complexity of our bodies without thinking at all. It should be noted, further, that we call our bodies complex as a result of trying to understand them in terms of linear thought, of words and concepts. But the complexity is not so much in our bodies as in the task of trying to understand them by this means of thinking. It is like trying to make out the features of a large room with no other light than a single bright ray. It is as complicated as trying to drink water with a fork instead of a cup.*

**The way that we actually perceive a room is by touching parts of it with our eyes and then letting the brain fill in the blanks and do some error correction when the feelers thrown out comes back with counterfactual information. If we'd explore a room by carefully bringing into awareness every part of it, we'd go insane. Viewing reality through our peripheral mind's eye, what does that feel like?

*Thus to begin to understand what Taoism is about, we must at least be prepared to admit the possibility of some view of the world other than the conventional, some knowledge other than the contents of our surface consciousness, which can apprehend reality only in the form of one abstraction (or thought, the Chinese nien d) at a time. There is no real di?culty in this, for we will already admit that we “know” how to move our hands, how to make a decision, or how to breathe, even though we can hardly begin to explain how we do it in words. We know how to do it because we just do it! Taoism is an extension of this kind of knowledge, an extension which gives us a very di?erent view of ourselves from that to which we are conventionally accustomed, and a view which liberates the human mind from its constricting identi?cation with the abstract ego.*

**To live by just being, to exist by just existing. Rather than trying to think and plan your way through something, just do it. Be it. Try to write instructions for how to tie shoelaces, you might succeed but it's less efficient than just showing and doing. Are there parallels in programming? I suppose in some sense, there's the imperative versus declarative paradigms but even the declarative paradigms don't quite capture a Taoist approach.

*In other words, the “rigorously scienti?c” method of predicting the future can be applied only in special cases–where prompt action is not urgent, where the factors involved are largely mechanical, or in circumstances so restricted as to be trivial. By far the greater part of our important decisions depend upon “hunch”– in other words, upon the “peripheral vision” of the mind. Thus the reliability of our decisions rests ultimately upon our ability to “feel” the situation, upon the degree to which this “peripheral vision” has been developed.*

**The most important decisions will necessarily need to be made this way. In v1 of a product most of your decisions will be opinion driven, since there's no data. It's in v2 where you can first start to make datadriven decisions, but that's because you're now just optimizing, you're not creating anything.

*Every exponent of the I Ching knows this. He knows that the book itself does not contain an exact science, but rather a useful tool which will work for him if he has a good “intuition,” or if, as he would say, he is “in the Tao.” Thus one does not consult the oracle without proper preparation, without going quietly and meticulously through the prescribed rituals in order to bring the mind into that calm state where the “intuition” is felt to act more e?ectively. It would seem, then, that if the origins of Taoism are to be found in the I Ching, they are not so much in the text of the book itself as in the way in which it was used and in the assumptions underlying it. For experience in making decisions by intuition might well show that this “peripheral” aspect of the mind works best when we do not try to interfere with it, when we trust it to work by itself–tzu-jan, spontaneously, “self-so.”*

**The book and the interaction with the book itself is as much of the wisdom it contains as the words themselves. In fact more so, the wisdom can only exist in the dynamic reality of process and practice.

*When we turn to ancient Chinese society, we ?nd two “philosophical” traditions playing complementary parts– Confucianism and Taoism. Generally speaking, the former concerns itself with the linguistic, ethical, legal, and ritual conventions which provide the society with its system of communication.
Confucianism, in other words, preoccupies itself with conventional knowledge, and under its auspices children are brought up so that their originally wayward and whimsical natures are made to ?t the Procrustean bed of the social order. The individual de?nes himself and his place in society in terms of the Confucian formulae.
Taoism, on the other hand, is generally a pursuit of older men, and especially of men who are retiring from active life in the community. Their retirement from society is a kind of outward symbol of an inward liberation from the bounds of conventional patterns of thought and conduct.*

**I believe that having one spiritual belief system throughout your whole life doesn't make sense. Your responsibilities and spiritual needs shift throughout your life. You go through phases. We should embrace the belief system that best serves the individual and the whole. It makes me think of the journey of a new employee. They obviously need to get different responsibilities and freedoms as they mature in the company.

*The important di?erence between the Tao and the usual idea of God is that whereas God produces the world by making (wei h), the Tao produces it by “not-making” (wu-wei i)–which is approximately what we mean by “growing.” For things made are separate parts put together, like machines, or things fashioned from without inwards, like sculptures. Whereas things grown divide themselves into parts, from within outwards. Because the natural universe works mainly according to the principles of growth, it would seem quite odd to the Chinese mind to ask how it was made.
If the universe were made, there would of course be someone who knows how it is made–who could explain how it was put together bit by bit as a technician can explain in one-at-a-time words how to assemble a machine. But a universe which grows utterly excludes the possibility of knowing how it grows in the clumsy terms of thought and language, so that no Taoist would dream of asking whether the Tao knows how it produces the universe. For it operates according to spontaneity, not according to plan.*

**It kind of sounds like something organic, evolution and non-objective search. There are principles one can derive from it, to make use of its properties. Although, just as I was labeling I got a sharp feeling that I'm moving away from it. Sometimes you find something by doing the opposite of searching for it.

*It is a state of wholeness in which the mind functions freely and easily, without the sensation of a second mind or ego standing over it with a club. If the ordinary man is one who has to walk by lifting his legs with his hands, the Taoist is one who has learned to let the legs walk by themselves.
Various passages in the Taoist writings suggest that “no-mindedness” is employing the whole mind as we use the eyes when we rest them upon various objects but make no special e?ort to take anything in.*

**The friction generated by the ego is like tires on the highway. It turns into an ambient noise that you don't notice until you pay attention. 

---
Page: 43

*In sum, then, te is the unthinkable ingenuity and creative power of man’s spontaneous and natural functioning–a power which is blocked when one tries to master it in terms of formal methods and techniques. It is like the centipede’s skill in using a hundred legs at once.
The centipede was happy, quite, Until a toad in fun Said, “Pray, which leg goes after which?”
This worked his mind to such a pitch, He lay distracted in a ditch, Considering how to run.*

**Is it related to expertise and flow?

*At the end of nine years, my mind gave free rein to its reflections,p my mouth free passage to its speech. Of right and wrong, pro?t and loss, I had no knowledge, either as touching myself or others.… Internal and external were blended into unity.
After that, there was no distinction between eye and ear, ear and nose, nose and mouth: all were the same. My mind was frozen, my body in dissolution, my ?esh and bones all melted together. I was wholly unconscious of what my body was resting on, or what was under my feet. I was borne this way and that on the wind, like dry cha? or leaves falling from a tree. In fact, I knew not whether the wind was riding on me or I on the wind.9*

**A total release of notions. A state of no-mind. Saying that it's shaped as a sculptor shapes his sculptures, what does that tell us? It tells us that it's defined by what it's not, it tells us that it grows from something that was already there.

*There are times when men’s passions are much more trustworthy than their principles. Since opposed principles, or ideologies, are irreconcilable, wars fought over principle will be wars of mutual annihilation. But wars fought for simple greed will be far less destructive, because the aggressor will be careful not to destroy what he is ?ghting to capture.
Reasonable–that is, human–men will always be capable of compromise, but men who have dehumanized themselves by becoming the blind worshipers of an idea or an ideal are fanatics whose devotion to abstractions makes them the enemies of life.*

**Fanaticism has its place. It's what has driven some people to do great things. On the whole, maybe it's caused more harm though.

Page: 51

*Every positive statement about ultimate things must be made in the suggestive form of myth, of poetry. For in this realm the direct and indicative form of speech can say only “Neti, neti” (“No, no”), since what can be described and categorized must always belong to the*

**The poems are usually playful, I wonder if that's a kind of acceptance that describing it through words is futile.

Page: 53

*At root, then, the philosophy becomes intelligible only by sharing the experience which consists of the same type of nonconventional knowledge found in Taoism. It is also termed atma-jnana (Self-knowledge) or atma-bodha (Self-awakening), since it may be considered as the discovery of who or what I am, when I am no longer identi?ed with any role or conventional de?nition of the person. Indian philosophy does not describe the content of this discovery except in mythological terms, using the phrase “I am Brahman” (aham brahman) or “That art thou” (tat tvam asi) to suggest that Self-knowledge is a realization of one’s original identity with God.*

**God is all. All is God. 

---
Page: 54

*But the emptiness must come ?rst. This is why Indian philosophy concentrates on negation, on liberating the mind from concepts of Truth. It proposes no idea, no description, of what is to ?ll the mind’s void because the idea would exclude the fact–somewhat as a picture of the sun on the windowpane would shut out the true sun’s light. Whereas the Hebrews would not permit an image of God in wood or stone, the Hindus will not permit an image of thought–unless it be so obviously mythological as not to be mistaken for the reality.*

**I wonder how this relates to depicting Allah. 

---
Page: 58

*Thus Indian philosophy speaks constantly of the unwisdom of pursuing things, of striving for the permanence of particular entities and events, because it sees in all this nothing more than an infatuation with ghosts, with the abstract measures of the mind (manas).7 Maya is, then, usually equated with nama-rupa or “name-and-form,” with the mind’s attempt to grasp the ?uid forms of nature in its mesh of ?xed classes. But when it is understood that form is ultimately void-in the special sense of ungraspable and immeasurable-the world of form is immediately seen as Brahman rather than maya. The formal world becomes the real world in the moment when it is no longer clutched, in the moment when its transitoriness of the world which is the sign of its divinity, of its actual identity with the indivisible and immeasurable in?nity of Brahman.*

**Is the world changing faster than we can categorize it? Why do we want to categorize? Why wouldn't we want to categorize it? Is it because it's futile and misleading? 

---
Page: 59

*Transitoriness is depressing only to the mind which insists upon trying to grasp. But to the mind which lets go and moves with the ?ow of change, which becomes, in Zen Buddhist imagery, like a ball in a mountain stream, the sense of transience or emptiness becomes a kind of ecstasy. This is perhaps why, in both East and West, impermanence is so often the theme of the most profound and moving poetry-so much so that the splendor of change shines through even when the poet seems to resent it the most.*

**Moving with the flow makes death not scary. 

---
Page: 63

*The anitya doctrine is, again, not quite the simple assertion that the world is impermanent, but rather that the more one grasps at the world, the more it changes. Reality in itself is neither permanent nor impermanent; it cannot be categorized. But when one tries to hold on to it, change is everywhere apparent, since, like one’s own shadow, the faster one pursues it, the faster it flees.*

**The harder we try the further away we get from it.

*For seven years Gautama had struggled by the traditional means of yoga and tapas, contemplation and ascesis, to penetrate the cause of man’s enslavement to maya, to ?nd release from the vicious circle of clinging-to-life (trishna) which is like trying to make the hand grasp itself. All his e?orts had been in vain. The eternal atman, the real Self, was not to be found. However much he concentrated upon his own mind to ?nd its root and ground, he found only his own e?ort to concentrate. The evening before his awakening he simply “gave up,” relaxed his ascetic diet, and ate some nourishing food.
Thereupon he felt at once that a profound change was coming over him. He sat beneath the tree, vowing never to rise until he had attained the supreme awakening, and-according to a tradition-sat all through the night until the ?rst glimpse of the morning star suddenly provoked a state of perfect clarity and understanding. This was anuttara samyak sambodhi, “unexcelled, complete awakening,” liberation from maya and from the everlasting Round of birth-and-death (samsara), which goes on and on for as long as a man tries in any way whatsoever to grasp at his own life.
Yet the actual content of this experience was never and could never be put into words. For words are the frames of maya, the meshes of its net, and the experience is of the water which slips through.*

**All the toughest challenges in my life have been worked through by not resisting anymore.

*If nirvana is related to the cessation (nir-) of turnings (vritti), the term is synonymous with the aim of yoga, de?ned in the Yogasutra as citta vritti nirodha–the cessation of turnings of the mind. These “turnings” are the thoughts whereby the mind endeavors to grasp the world and itself. Yoga is the practice of trying to stop these thoughts by thinking about them, until the utter futility of the process is felt so vividly that it simply drops away, and the mind discovers its natural and unconfused state.*

**It's when you try so hard that you break that you finally let go. 

---
Page: 66

*To attain nirvana is also to attain Buddhahood, awakening. But this is not attainment in any ordinary sense, because no acquisition and no motivation are involved. It is impossible to desire nirvana, or to intend to reach it, for anything desirable or conceivable as an object of action is, by definition, not nirvana. Nirvana can only arise grasping has been thoroughly perceived. A Buddha, therefore, is a man of no rank. He is not above, like an angel; he is not below, like a demon. He does not appear anywhere in the six divisions of the Round, and it would be mistaken to think of him as superior to the angels, for the law of the Round is that what goes up must come down, and vice versa. He has transcended all dualities whatsoever, and thus it would mean nothing to him to think of himself as a superior person or a spiritual success.*

**If you desire something from awakening, you've missed the point. The cessation of desire and grasping. 

---
Page: 68

*Through such awareness it is seen that the separation of the thinker from the thought, the knower from the known, the subject from the object, is purely abstract. There is not the mind on the one hand and its experiences on the other: there is just a process of experiencing in which there is nothing to be grasped, as an object, and no one, as a subject, to grasp it. Seen thus, the process of experiencing ceases to clutch at itself. Thought follows thought without interruption, that is, without any need to divide itself from itself, so as to become its own object.*

**A complete clarity of mind, oh what frictionless flowy sweetness.

*Sitting meditation is not, as is often supposed, a spiritual “exercise,” a practice followed for some ulterior object. From a Buddhist standpoint, it is simply the proper way to sit, and it seems perfectly natural to remain sitting so long as there is nothing else to be done, and so long as one is not consumed with nervous agitation. To the restless temperament of the West, sitting meditation may seem to be an unpleasant discipline, because we do not seem to be able to sit “just to sit” without qualms of conscience, without feeling that we ought to be doing something more important to justify our existence. To propitiate this restless conscience, sitting meditation must therefore be regarded as an exercise, a discipline with an ulterior motive. Yet at that: very point it ceases to be meditation (dhyana) in the Buddhist sense, for where there is purpose, where there is seeking and grasping for results, there is no dhyana.*

**Maybe sitting isn't the right posture for meditating when you're soaked in western culture? I kind of get what it means to do a thing just the proper way. On acid it becomes perfectly apparent how to properly take a breath that fills you up completely, or how to stretch your arms and legs when you walk. 

---
Page: 65

*The active principle of the Round is known as karma or “conditioned action,” action, that is, arising from a motive and seeking a result-the type of action which always requires the necessity for further action. Man is involved in karma when he interferes with the world in such a way that he is compelled to go on interfering, when the solution of a problem creates still more problems to be solved, when the control of one thing creates the need to control several others. Karma is thus the fate of everyone who “tries to be God.” He lays a trap for the world in which he himself gets caught.*

**This is true for us at a group level as well. We're digging ourselves deeper and deeper by well meaning solutions to problems that have come from previous well meaning solutions. I thought karma was a good concept, turns out it's not desirable. 

---
Page: 64

*This is really a simple problem of what we now call cybernetics, the science of control. Mechanically and logically it is easy to see that any system approaching perfect self-control is also approaching perfect self-frustration. Such a system is a vicious circle, and has the same logical structure as a statement which states something about itself, as for example, “I am lying,” when it is implied that the statement is itself a lie. The statement circulates fatuously forever, since it is always true to the extent that it is false, and false to the extent that it is true. Expressed more concretely, I cannot throw a ball so long as I am holding on to it–so as to maintain perfect control of its movement.
Thus the desire for perfect control, of the environment and of the failure to see the basic self-contradiction of this position. From it therefore arises a futile grasping or controlling of life which is pure self-frustration, and the pattern of life which follows is the vicious circle which in Hinduism and Buddhism is called samsara, the Round of birth-and-death.10*

**This reminds of Godels incompleteness theorem. 

**It's so compelling to the curiosity of the ego when there are similarities and explanations that can be given through math. Proving that perfect self control is bad for the system is telling us something deep about reality, 

**Should we strive for nomind because our mind is too weak to grasp reality consciously? Would it be different if we had more horse power?

*The traditional Mahayanist account of its own origin is that its teachings were delivered by the Buddha to his intimate disciples but their public revelation withheld until the world was ready for them. The principle of “delayed revelation” is a well-known expedient for permitting the growth of a tradition, for exploring the implications contained in the original seed.*

**Bitcoin had a delayed revelation phase too. 

---
Page: 78

*To strive, then, to blot out the conventional world of things and events is to admit that it exists in reality. Hence the Mahayanist principie that “what has never arisen does not have to be annihilated.” a These are not the idle speculations and sophistries of a system of subjective idealism or nihilism. They are answers to a practical problem which may be expressed thus: “If my grasping of life involves me in a vicious circle, how am I to learn not to grasp?
How can I try to let go when trying is precisely not letting go?”
Stated in another way, to try not to grasp is the same thing as to grasp, since its motivation is the same–my urgent desire to save myself from a difficulty. I cannot get rid of this desire, since it is one and the same desire as the desire to get rid of it! This is the familiar, everyday problem of the psychological “double-bind,” of creating the problem by trying to solve it, of worrying because one worries, and of being afraid of fear.*

**What is the solution? Just letting go?

---
Page: 82

*The point arrives, then, when it is clearly understood that all one’s intentional acts-desires, ideals, stratagems-are in vain. In the whole universe, within and without, there is nothing whereon to lay any hold, and no one to lay any hold on anything. This has been discovered through clear awareness of everything that seemed to o?er a solution or to constitute a reliable reality, through the intuitive wisdom called prajna, which sees into the relational character of everything. With the “eye of prajna” the human a pursuit of goals which simply require the pursuit of other goals, a clutching of objects which the swift course of time renders as insubstantial as mist. The very one who pursues, who sees and knows and desires, the inner subject, has his existence only in relation to the ephemeral objects of his pursuit. He sees that his grasp upon the world is his strangle-hold about his own neck, the hold which is depriving him of the very life he so longs to attain.
And there is no way out, no way of letting go, which he can take by e?ort, by a decision of the will.… But who is it that wants to get out?
There comes a moment when this consciousness of the inescapable trap in which we are at once the trapper and the trapped reaches a breaking point. One might almost say that it “matures” or “ripens,” and suddenly there is what the Lankavatara Sutra calls a “turning about in the deepest seat of consciousness.” In this moment all sense of constraint drops away, and the cocoon which the silkworm spun around himself opens to let him go forth winged as a moth. The peculiar anxiety which Kierkegaard has rightly seen to lie at the very roots of the ordinary man’s soul is no longer there. Contrivances, ideals, ambitions, and self-propitiations are no longer necessary, since it is now possible to live spontaneously without trying to be spontaneous. Indeed, there is no alternative, since it is now seen that there never was any self to bring the self under its control.*

**The path for many enlightened ones must have looked roughly the same. Why not describe that? Maybe the path would necessarily shift if it got to be an object of desire? Either way I think one needs to grasp really hard before realizing it's futile. Realizing in the sense of knowing it in your bones, it's not something you can be told or simply want into existence.

*since one’s own true nature is already the Buddha nature, one does not have to do anything to make it so. On the contrary, to seek to become Buddha is to deny that one is already Buddha–and this is the sole basis upon which Buddhahood can be realized! In short, to become a Buddha it is only necessary to have the faith that one is a Buddha already.*

**What has not been lost cannot be found. You'll search forever if you look for the car keys that were in your hand all along.

*A simpli?ed, and somewhat rough, way of stating the di?erence is that Western idealists have begun to philosophize from a world consisting of mind (or spirit), form, and matter, whereas the Buddhists have begun to philosophize from a world of mind and form.
The Yogacara does not, therefore, discuss the relation of forms of matter to mind; it discusses the relation of forms to mind, and concludes that they are forms of mind. As a result, the term “mind” (citta) becomes logically meaningless. But because the main concern of Buddhism is with a realm of experience which is nonlogical and meaningless, in the sense that it does not symbolize or signify anything other than itself, there is no objection to “meaningless” terms.
From the logical standpoint the proposition “Everything is mind” says no more than that everything is everything. For if there is nothing which is not mind, the word belongs to no class, and has no limits, no de?nition. One might as well use “blah”–which is almost exactly what Buddhism does with the nonsense word tathata. For the function of these nonsense terms is to draw our attention to the of thought and language but not of the actual world. The nonverbal, concrete world contains no classes and no symbols which signify or mean anything other than themselves. Consequently it contains no duality. For duality arises only when we classify, when we sort our experiences into mental boxes, since a box is no box without an inside and an outside.*

**Language really is inferior to experience. It's too limited and too open for paradoxes.

*This is, I think, what the Yogacara means by the assertion that the world is mind-only (cittamatram lokam). It means that external and internal, before and after, heavy and light, pleasant and painful, moving and still are all ideas, or mental classi?cations. Their relation to the concrete world is the same as that of words. Thus the world that we know, when understood as the world as classi?ed, is a product of the mind, and as the sound “water” is not actually water, the classified world is not the real world.*

**It's not the flag moving, it's not the wind moving, it's your own mind moving.

*But in Zen there is always the feeling that awakening is something quite natural, something startlingly obvious, which may occur at any moment. If it involves a di?culty, it is just that it is much too simple. Zen is also direct in its way of teaching, for it points directly and openly to the truth, and does not trifle with symbolism.*

**Take reality at face value, don't resist, surrender to what you experience.

*Six Precepts” of Tilopa:
No thought, no reflection, no analysis, No cultivation, no intention;
Let it settle itself.*

*Though the Chinese Buddhist masters were normally monks, they had large numbers of advanced lay students, and Zen, expression of Buddhism in formally secular terms–in arts of every type, in manual labor, and in appreciation of the natural universe.
Confucian and Taoist alike would be especially agreeable to the idea of an awakening which did not involve the extermination of human passions, as klesa may also be translated. We have already noted the peculiar trust in human nature which both these philosophies professed. However, not exterminating the passions does not mean letting them ?ourish untamed. It means letting go of them rather than ?ghting them, neither repressing passion nor indulging it. For the Taoist is never violent, since he achieves his ends by noninterference (wu-wei), which is a kind of psychological judo.*

**Like Christianity the Zen tradition seems to have gained quite a lot of memetic power by speaking to the lay people.

*Hui-k’o again and again asked Bodhidharma for instruction, but was always refused. Yet he continued to sit in meditation outside the cave, waiting patiently in the snow in the hope that Bodhidharma would at last relent. In desperation he ?nally cut o?
his left arm and presented it to Bodhidharma as a token of his agonized sincerity. At this Bodhidharma at last asked Hui-k’o what he wanted.
“I have no peace of mind [hsin],” said Hui-k’o. “Please pacify my mind.”
“Bring out your mind here before me,” replied Bodhidharma, “and I will pacify it!”
“But when I seek my own mind,” said Hui-k’o, “I cannot find it.”
“There!” snapped Bodhidharma, “I have pacified your mind!”15 g At this moment Hui-k’o had his awakening, his tun-wu or satori, so that this interchange purports to be the ?rst instance of what became the characteristic Zen method of instruction–the wen-ta h (Japanese, mondo) or “question-and-answer,” sometimes loosely called the “Zen story.” The greater part of Zen literature consists of these anecdotes, many of them much more puzzling than this, and their aim is always to precipitate some type of sudden realization in the questioner’s mind, or to test the depth of his insight. For this reason, such anecdotes cannot be “explained” without spoiling their e?ect. In some respects they are like jokes which do not produce their intended e?ect of laughter when the “punch line” requires further explanation. One must see the point immediately, or not at all.*

**Zen teachings are like a baseball bat, it swings and if it hits you're awakened, if it misses nothing happened.

*The satori which so frequently follows these interchanges is by no means a mere comprehension of the answer to a riddle. For utterance of “suchness,” of his Buddha nature, and what he gives is no symbol but the very thing. Zen communication is always “direct pointing,” in line with the traditional four-phrase summary of Zen:
Outside teaching; apart from tradition.
Not founded on words and letters.
Pointing directly to the human mind.
Seeing into one’s nature and attaining Buddhahood.*

**Zen is very dynamic and alive. If a master would be broadcasting from a reality that's constantly shifting, what he says will necessarily change based on the very specific arrangement that the universe is in, including the constellation of atoms that is the student he is talking to. Each and every moment is unique, and as such the same master moved to a different time and space should be saying completely different things. This assumes that there's no abstraction that's able to capture their teachings. How the hell does one capture that on paper? Would it be possible to create a story that's completely void of any pattern that's been seen before?

*Follow your nature and accord with the Tao;
Saunter along and stop worrying.
If your thoughts are tied you spoil what is genuine.… Don’t be antagonistic to the world of the senses, For when you are not antagonistic to it, It turns out to be the same as complete Awakening.
The wise person does not strive (wu-wei);
The ignorant man ties himself up.… If you work on your mind with your mind, How can you avoid an immense confusion?*

**In some sense our self-reflective loop is insufficiently capable to work out itself. It gets stuck in infinite loops. It reminds a bit of strange loops.

*As the two men were talking, a wild animal roared close by, and Tao-hsin jumped.
Fa-yung commented, “I see it is still with you!”–referring, of course, to the instinctive “passion” (klesa) of fright. Shortly afterwards, while he was for a moment unobserved, Tao-hsin wrote the Chinese character for “Buddha” on the rock where Fa-yung was accustomed to sit. When Fa-yung returned to sit down again, he saw the sacred Name and hesitated to sit. “I see,” said Tao-hsin, “it is still with you!” At this remark Fa-yung was fully awakened … and the birds never brought any more flowers.*

**Is possible to be fully void of preconceived notions? To be silly about it, but these master's pottytraining is a form of preconceived notion, same with their movement, their language and so on. That might be to completely miss the point of transcending. You don't need to remove yourself but you need something that subsumes it.

*Hui-neng’s position was that a man with an empty consciousness was no better than “a block of wood or a lump of stone.” He insisted that the whole idea of purifying the mind was irrelevant and confusing, because “our own nature is fundamentally clear and pure.” In other words, there is no analogy between consciousness or mind and a mirror that can be wiped. The true mind is “no-mind” (wu-hsin), which is to say that it is not to be regarded as an object of thought or action, as if it were a thing to be grasped and controlled. The attempt to work on one’s own mind is a vicious circle. To try to purify it is to be contaminated with purity.
Obviously this is the Taoist philosophy of naturalness, according to which a person is not genuinely free, detached, or pure when his state is the result of an arti?cial discipline. He is just imitating purity, just “faking” clear awareness. Hence the unpleasant self-righteousness of those who are deliberately and methodically religious.*

**The most profound paragraph so far. It's so much truer to everyday experience, and it's so clear of self-righteous, virtuesignalling bullshit. It's a true interpretation of nomind, not some sort of romantization of it.

*Hui-neng’s teaching is that instead of trying to purify or empty the mind, one must simply let go of the mind–because the mind is nothing to be grasped. Letting go of the mind is also equivalent to letting go of the series of thoughts and impressions (nien) which come and go “in” the mind, neither repressing them, holding them, nor interfering with them.
Thoughts come and go of themselves, for through the use of wisdom there is no blockage. This is the samadhi of prajna, and natural liberation. Such is the practice of “no-thought” [wu-nien].
But if you do not think of anything at all, and immediately command thoughts to cease, this is to be tied in a knot by a method, and is called an obtuse view. (2) n*

*This sounds, of course, as though “Zen ?avor” were a studied and a?ected primitivism. Sometimes it is. But the genuine Zen ?avor is when a man is almost miraculously natural without intending to be so. His Zen life is not to make himself but to grow that way.
Thus it should be obvious that the “naturalness” of these T’ang masters is not to be taken just literally, as if Zen were merely to glory in being a completely ordinary, vulgar fellow who scatters ideals to the wind and behaves as he pleases–for this would in itself be an a?ectation. The “naturalness” of Zen ?ourishes only when one has lost a?ectedness and self-consciousness of every description.
But a spirit of this kind comes and goes like the wind, and is the most impossible thing to institutionalize and preserve.*

**There's a different quality to the naturalness, besides just pure unthinking hedonism.

*For the Zen community became less an association of mature men with spiritual interests, and more of an ecclesiastical boarding school for adolescent boys.
Under such circumstances the problem of discipline became paramount. The Zen masters were forced to concern themselves not only with the way of liberation from convention, but also with the instilling of convention, of ordinary manners and morals, in raw youths.*

**I wondered where the discipline aspect came from, all descriptions I've heard so far make no mention of it, yet it's clearly a big part of it. So it arose from more of practical organizational need.

*Whereas the koan advocates used this technique as a means for encouraging that overwhelming “feeling of doubt” (i ching ff) which they felt to be essential as a prerequisite for satori, the Soto School argued that it lent itself too easily to that very seeking for satori which thrusts it away, or–what is worse–induces an arti?cial satori. Adherents of the Rinzai School sometimes say that the intensity of the satori is proportionate to the intensity of the feeling of doubt, of blind seeking, which precedes it, but for Soto this suggests that such a satori has a dualistic character, and is thus no more than an arti?cial emotional reaction. Thus the Soto view was that proper dhyana lay in motiveless action (wu-wei), in “sitting just to sit,” or “walking just to walk.” The two schools therefore came to be known respectively as k’an-hua Zen (observing the anecdote Zen) and mo-chao Zen (silently illumined Zen).*

**Isn't all of this a search for satori? It goes all the way down until you don't even begin to form any thoughts about it. Even a small spark will light up an entire dark room.

*To train yourself in sitting meditation [za-zen] is to train yourself to be a sitting Buddha. If you train yourself in za-zen, (you should know that) Zen is neither sitting nor lying. If you train yourself to be a sitting Buddha, (you should know that) the Buddha is not a ?xed form. Since the Dharma has no (?xed) abode, it is not a matter of making choices. If you (make yourself) a sitting Buddha this is precisely killing the Buddha. If you adhere to the sitting position, you will not attain the principle (of Zen)*

**The emphasis on sitting is certainly strange, especially considering what the old masters are saying and what a first principles thought would say about it. 

---
Page: 125

*Even in Japanese Zen one occasionally encounters a Zen practice which lays no special emphasis upon za-zen, but rather stresses the use of one’s ordinary work as the means of meditation. This was certainly true of Bankei,48 and this principle underlies the common use of such arts as “tea ceremony,” ?ute playing, brush drawing, archery, fencing, and ju-jutsu as ways of practicing Zen. Perhaps, then, the exaggeration of za-zen in later times is part and parcel of the conversion of the Zen monastery into a boys’ training school. To have them sit still for hours on end under the watchful eyes of monitors with sticks is certainly a sure method of keeping them out of mischief.
Yet however much za-zen may have been exaggerated in the Far East, a certain amount of “sitting just to sit” might well be the best thing in the world for the jittery minds and agitated bodies of Europeans and Americans–provided they do not use it as a method for turning themselves into Buddhas.*

*The point is not to make an e?ort to silence the feelings and cultivate bland indi?erence. It is to see through the universal illusion that what is pleasant or good may be wrested from what is painful or evil. It was a first principle in Taoism that When everyone recognizes beauty as beautiful, there is already ugliness;
When everyone recognizes goodness as good, there is already evil.
“To be” and “not to be” arise mutually;
Difficult and easy are mutually realized;
Long and short are mutually contrasted;
High and low are mutually posited; … Before and after are in mutual sequence.2 To see this is to see that good without evil is like up without down, and that to make an ideal of pursuing the good is like trying to get rid of the left by turning constantly to the right. One is therefore compelled to go round in circles.3*

*The logic of this is so simple that one is tempted to think it over-simple. The temptation is all the stronger because it upsets the fondest illusion of the human mind, which is that in the course of time everything may be made better and better. For it is the general opinion that were this not possible the life of man would lack all meaning and incentive. The only alternative to a life of constant progress is felt to be a mere existence, static and dead, so joyless and inane that one might as well commit suicide. The very notion of this “only alternative” shows how ?rmly the mind is bound in a dualistic pattern, how hard it is to think in any other terms than good or bad, or a muddy mixture of the two.*

*When ?rewood becomes ashes, it never returns to being ?rewood. But we should not take the view that what is latterly ashes was formerly ?rewood. What we should understand is that, according to the doctrine of Buddhism, ?rewood stays at the position of ?rewood.… There are former and later stages, but these stages are clearly cut.
It is the same with life and death. Thus we say in Buddhism that the Un-born is also the Un-dying. Life is a position of time.
Death is a position of time. They are like winter and spring, and in Buddhism we do not consider that winter becomes spring, or that spring becomes summer.9*

*The flowers depart when we hate to lose them;
The weeds arrive while we hate to watch them grow.
This is perfectly natural, perfectly human, and no pulling and stretching of time will make it otherwise.
On the contrary, the measuring of worth and success in terms of time, and the insistent demand for assurances of a promising future, make it impossible to live freely both in the present and in the “promising” future when it arrives. For there is never anything but the present, and if one cannot live there, one cannot live anywhere.*

*When we are no longer identi?ed with the idea of ourselves, the entire relationship between subject and object, knower and known, undergoes a sudden and revolutionary change. It becomes a real relationship, a mutuality in which the subject creates the object just as much as the object creates the subject. The knower no longer feels himself to be independent of the known; the experiencer no longer feels himself to stand apart from the experience.
Consequently the whole notion of getting something “out” of life, of seeking something “from” experience, becomes absurd. To put it in another way, it becomes vividly clear that in concrete fact I have no other self than the totality of things of which I am aware. This is the Hua-yen (Kegon) doctrine of the net of jewels, of shih shih wu ai (Japanese, ji ji mu ge), in which every jewel contains the re?ection of all the others.*

**It's all just one fabric.

*It would seem, then, that to get rid of the subjective distinction between “me” and “my experience”–through seeing that my idea of myself is not myself–is to discover the actual relationship between myself and the “outside” world. The individual, on the one hand, and the world, on the other, are simply the abstract limits or terms of a concrete reality which is “between” them, as the concrete coin is “between” the abstract, Euclidean surfaces of its two sides.
Similarly, the reality of all “inseparable opposites”–life and death, good and evil, pleasure and pain, gain and loss–is that “between” for which we have no words.*

**We are the whole coin and the world in which the coin exists.

*One day I wiped out all the notions from my mind. I gave up all desire. I discarded all the words with which I thought and stayed in quietude. I felt a little queer–as if I were being carried into something, or as if I were touching some power unknown to me … and Ztt! I entered. I lost the boundary of my physical body.
I had my skin, of course, but I felt I was standing in the center of the cosmos. I spoke, but my words had lost their meaning. I saw people coming towards me, but all were the same man. All were myself! I had never known this world. I had believed that I was created, but now I must change my opinion: I was never created;
I was the cosmos; no individual Mr. Sasaki existed.7*

*The masters are resolute in cutting short all theorizing and speculation about these answers. “Direct pointing” entirely fails in its intention if it requires or stimulates any conceptual comment.
Fa-yen asked the monk Hsüan-tzu why he had never asked him any questions about Zen. The monk explained that he had already attained his understanding from another master. Pressed by Fa-yen for an explanation, the monk said that when he had asked his teacher, “What is the Buddha?” he had received the answer, “Ping-ting T’ung-tzu comes for fire!”
“A good answer!” said Fa-yen. “But I’m sure you don’t understand it.”
“Ping-ting,” explained the monk, “is the god of fire. For him to be seeking for ?re is like myself, seeking the Buddha. I’m the Buddha already, and no asking is needed.”
“Just as I thought!” laughed Fa-yen. “You didn’t get it.”
The monk was so o?ended that he left the monastery, but later repented of himself and returned, humbly requesting instruction.
“You ask me,” said Fa-yen.
“What is the Buddha?” inquired the monk.
“Ping-ting T’ung-tzu comes for fire!”*

*The di?culty of Zen is, of course, to shift one’s attention from the abstract to the concrete, from the symbolic self to one’s true nature.
So long as we merely talk about it, so long as we turn over ideas in our minds about “symbol” and “reality,” or keep repeating, “I am not my idea of myself,” this is still mere abstractíon. Zen created the method (upaya) of “direct pointing” in order to escape from this vicious circle, in order to thrust the real immediately to our notice.
When reading a di?cult book it is of no help to think, “I should concentrate,” for one thinks about concentration instead of what the book has to say. Likewise, in studying or practicing Zen it is of no help to think about Zen. To remain caught up in ideas and words about Zen is, as the old masters say, to “stink of Zen.”*

*In R. H. Blyth’s arresting metaphor, when we were just about to swat the ?y, the ?y ?ew up and sat on the swatter. In terms of immediate perception, when we look for things there is nothing but mind, and when we look for mind there is nothing but things. For a moment we are paralyzed, because it seems that we have no basis for action, no ground under foot from which to take a jump. But this is the way it always was, and in the next moment we ?nd ourselves as free to act, speak, and think as ever, yet in a strange and miraculous new world from which “self” and “other,” “mind” and “things” have vanished. In the words of Te-shan:
Only when you have no thing in your mind and no mind in things are you vacant and spiritual, empty and marvelous.*

*In both life and art the cultures of the Far East appreciate nothing more highly than spontaneity or naturalness (tzu-jan). This is the unmistakable tone of sincerity marking the action which is not studied and contrived. For a man rings like a cracked bell when he thinks and acts with a split mind-one part standing aside to interfere with the other, to control, to condemn, or to admire. But the mind, or the true nature, of man cannot actually be split.
According to a Zenrin poem, it is Like a sword that cuts, but cannot cut itself;
Like an eye that sees, but cannot see itself.a The illusion of the split comes from the mind’s attempt to be both itself and its idea of itself, from a fatal confusion of fact with symbol. To make an end of the illusion, the mind must stop trying to act upon itself, upon its stream of experiences, from the standpoint of the idea of itself which we call the ego.*

**Who's doing this? I'm doing it? Who are you? What is this? Is metacognition a trap or can you transcend and embed it?

*In walking, just walk. In sitting, just sit. Above all, don’t wobble.” For the essential quality of naturalness is the sincerity of the undivided mind which does not dither between alternatives. So when Yen-t’ou screamed, it was such a scream that it was heard for miles around.*

**Actions without friction. Smooth and totally unhindered, flowing. 

---
Page: 152

*But it would be quite wrong to suppose that this natural sincerity comes about by observing such a platitude as “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.” When Yen-t’ou screamed, he was not screaming in order to be natural, nor did he ?rst make up his mind to scream and then implement the decision with the full energy of his will. There is a total contradiction in planned naturalness and intentional sincerity. This is to overlay, not to discover, the “original mind.” Thus to try to be natural is an a?ectation. To try not to try to be natural is also an a?ectation. As a Zenrin poem says:
You cannot get it by taking thought;
You cannot seek it by not taking thought.*

**Spontaneous play has all those qualities. A state flow has all those qualities. Is it possible to be in a constant state of flow?

*Every feedback system needs a margin of “lag” or error. If we try to make a thermostat absolutely accurate–that is, if we bring the upper and lower limits of temperature very close together in an attempt to hold the temperature at a constant 70 degrees–the whole system will break down. For to the extent that the upper and lower limits coincide, the signals for switching o? and switching on will coincide! If 70 degrees is both the lower and upper limit the “go” sign will also be the “stop” sign; “yes” will imply “no” and “no” will imply “yes.” Whereupon the mechanism will start “trembling,” going on and o?, on and o?, until it shakes itself to pieces. The system is too sensitive and shows symptoms which are startlingly like human anxiety. For when a human being is so self-conscious, so self-controlled that he cannot let go of himself, he dithers or wobbles between opposites. This is precisely what is meant in Zen by going round and round on “the wheel of birth-and-death,” for the Buddhist samsara is the prototype of all vicious circles.*

**It's fun to see a mechanistic explanation for anxiety. Is it possible to make mechanistic analogies for every possible state of consciousness? Or is there something about the virtual nature of consciousness that makes that impossible? This explanation reminds me of a relief valve that's jittery.

*The proper adjustment of a feed-back system is always a complex mechanical problem. For the original machine, say, the furnace, is adjusted by the feed-back system, but this system in turn needs adjustment. Therefore to make a mechanical system more and more automatic will require the use of a series of feed-back systems–a second to correct the ?rst, a third to correct the second, and so on.
But there are obvious limits to such a series, for beyond a certain point the mechanism will be “frustrated” by its own complexity.
For example, it might take so long for the information to pass through the series of control systems that it would arrive at the original machine too late to be useful. Similarly, when human beings think too carefully and minutely about an action to be taken, they cannot make up their minds in time to act. In other words, one cannot correct one’s means of self-correction inde?nitely. There must soon be a source of information at the end of the line which is the ?nal authority. Failure to trust its authority will make it impossible to act, and the system will be paralyzed.*

**It's like a halting problem.

*But re?ection is also action, and Yün-men might also have said, “In acting, just act. In thinking, just think. Above all, don’t wobble.”
In other words, if one is going to re?ect, just re?ect–but do not re?ect about re?ecting. Yet Zen would agree that re?ection about re?ection is also action–provided that in doing it we do just that, and do not tend to drift o? into the in?nite regression of trying always to stand above or outside the level upon which we are acting. Thus Zen is also a liberation from the dualism of thought and action, for it thinks as it acts–with the same quality of abandon, commitment, or faith. The attitude of wu-hsin is by no means an anti-intellectualist exclusion of thinking. Wu-hsin is action on any level whatsoever, physical or psychic, without trying at the same moment to observe and check the action from outside. This attempt to act and think about the action simultaneously is precisely the identi?cation of the mind with its idea of itself. It involves the same contradiction as the statement which states something about itself–“This statement is false.”*

**Breaking out of the infinite regress allows us to act smoothly and not jittery like a broken thermostat.

Page: 157

*Whether trusting our memories or trusting the mind to act on its own, it comes to the same thing: ultimately we must act and think, live and die, from a source beyond all “our” knowledge and control. But this source is ourselves, and when we see that, it no longer stands over against us as a threatening object. No amount of care and hesitancy, no amount of introspection and searching of our motives, can make any ultimate di?erence to the fact that the mind is Like an eye that sees, but cannot see itself.*

**No amount of steps in metacognition will let us reach an end, we'll just be paralyzed by the infinite loop it creates. The mind is used to think, but it cannot wrap around itself.

*Men are afraid to forget their own minds, fearing to fall through the void with nothing on to which they can cling. They do not know that the void is not really the void but the real realm of the Dharma.… It cannot be looked for or sought, comprehended by wisdom or knowledge, explained in words, contacted materially (i.e., objectively) or reached by meritorious achievement. (14)5 Now this impossibility of “grasping the mind with the mind” is, when realized, the non-action (wu-wei), the “sitting quietly, doing nothing” whereby “spring comes, and the grass grows by itself.”
There is no necessity for the mind to try to let go of itself, or to try not to try.*

**Trying not to try, not to try, not to try, not to try. I'm a knot that cannot become more knot. 

---
Page: 159

*With this in mind, we can observe the freedom and naturalness of Zen without loss of perspective. Social conditioning fosters the identi?cation of the mind with a ?xed idea of itself as the means of self-control, and as a result man thinks of himself as “I”–the ego.
Thereupon the mental center of gravity shifts from the spontaneous or original mind to the ego image. Once this has happened, the very center of our psychic life is identi?ed with the self-controlling mechanism. It then becomes almost impossible to see how “I” can let go of “myself,” for I am precisely my habitual e?ort to hold on to myself. I ?nd myself totally incapable of any mental action which is not intentional, a?ected, and insincere. Therefore anything I do to give myself up, to let go, will be a disguised form of the habitual e?ort to hold on. I cannot be intentionally unintentional or purposely spontaneous. As soon as it becomes important for me to be spontaneous, the intention to be so is strengthened; I cannot get rid of it, and yet it is the one thing that stands in the way of its own ful?llment. It is as if someone had given me some medicine with the warning that it will not work if I think of a monkey while taking it.
While I am remembering to forget the monkey, I am in a “double-bind” situation where “to do” is “not to do,” and vice versa.
“Yes” implies “no,” and “go” implies “stop.” At this point Zen comes to me and asks, “If you cannot help remembering the monkey, are you doing it on purpose?” In other words, do I have an intention for being intentional, a purpose for being purposive?
Suddenly I realize that my very intending is spontaneous, or that my controlling self–the ego–arises from my uncontrolled or natural self.
At this moment all the machinations of the ego come to nought; it is annihilated in its own trap. I see that it is actually impossible not to be spontaneous. For what I cannot help doing I am doing spontaneously, but if I am at the same time trying to control it, I interpret it as a compulsion. As a Zen master said, “Nothing is left to you at this moment but to have a good laugh.”
In this moment the whole quality of consciousness is changed, and I feel myself in a new world in which, however, it is obvious that I have always been living. As soon as I recognize that my voluntary and purposeful action happens spontaneously “by itself,” just like breathing, hearing, and feeling, I am no longer caught in contradiction, since “trying” is “spontaneity.” Seeing this, the compulsive, blocked, and “tied-up” feeling vanishes. It is just as if I had been absorbed in a tug-of-war between my two hands, and had forgotten that both were mine. No block to spontaneity remains when the trying is seen to be needless. As we saw, the discovery that both the voluntary and involuntary aspects of the mind are alike spontaneous makes an immediate end of the ?xed dualism between the mind and the world, the knower and the known. The new world in which I ?nd myself has an extraordinary transparency or freedom from barriers, making it seem that I have somehow become the empty space in which everything is happening.
Here, then, is the point of the oft-repeated assertion that “all beings are in nirvana from the very beginning,” that “all dualism is falsely imagined,” that “the ordinary mind is the Tao” and that there is therefore no meaning in trying to get into accord with it.*

**Nothing changes apart from experiencing the same things from a different perspective. A perspective that's without attachments or suffering, a perspective that sees things for what they are.

*Furthermore, the Zen experience is more of a conclusion than a premise. It is never to be used as the ?rst step in a line of ethical or metaphysical reasoning, since conclusions draw to it rather than from it. Like the Beati?c Vision of Christianity, it is a “which than which there is no whicher”–the true end of man–not a thing to be used for some other end. Philosophers do not easily recognize that there is a point where thinking-like boiling an egg-must come to a stop. To try to formulate the Zen experience as a proposition–“everything is the Tao”–and then to analyze it and draw conclusions from it is to miss it completely. Like the Cruci?xion, it is “to the Jews [the moralists] a stum-blingblock and to the Greeks [the logicians] foolishness.” To say that “everything is the Tao” almost gets the point, but just at the moment of getting it, the words crumble into nonsense. For we are here at a limit at which words break down because they always imply a meaning beyond themselves–and here there is no meaning beyond.
Zen does not make the mistake of using the experience “all things are of one Suchness” as the premise for an ethic of universal brotherhood. On the contrary, Yüan-wu says:
If you are a real man, you may by all means drive o? with the farmer’s ox, or grab the food from a starving man.12 l This is only to say that Zen lies beyond the ethical standpoint, whose sanctions must be found, not in reality itself, but in the mutual agreement of human beings. When we attempt to universalize or absolutize it, the ethical standpoint makes it impossible to exist, for we cannot live for a day without destroying the life of some other creature.*

**If nothing can go beyond it, it feels like it's riding in the frontseat of a photon. 

**Ethics is so worldly, of course it can't be part of the divine and the absolute. I wonder why so many religions care about it. Maybe it's because they're trying to fill two roles, one is to describe God and the other is to describe how to live. Zen let's confucianism deal with that part. In that sense it's very clean and simple.

*While the Zen experience does not imply any speci?c course of action, since it has no purpose, no motivation, it turns unhesitatingly to anything that presents itself to be done. Mo chih ch’u is the mind functioning without blocks, without “wobbling” between alternatives, and much of Zen training consists in confronting the student with dilemmas which he is expected to handle without stopping to deliberate and “choose.” The response to the situation must follow with the immediacy of sound issuing from the hands when they are clapped, or sparks from a ?int when struck. The student unaccustomed to this type of response will at ?rst be confused, but as he gains faith in his “original” or spontaneous mind he will not only respond with ease, but the responses themselves will acquire a startling appropriateness. This is something like the professional comedian’s gift of unprepared wit which is equal to any situation.*

**This has a bit of a gradualist smell to it. The way it's described makes it seem as the longer you're in tune with your true natural self the more in tune it gets with the universe.

*Both Takuan and Bankei stressed the fact that the “original” or “unborn” mind is constantly working miracles even in the most ordinary person. Even though a tree has innumerable leaves, the mind takes them in all at once without being “stopped” by any one of them. Explaining this to a visiting monk, Bankei said, “To prove that your mind is the Buddha mind, notice how all that I say here goes into you without missing a single thing, even though I don’t try to push it into you.”14 When heckled by an aggressive Nichiren monk who kept insisting that he couldn’t understand a word, Bankei asked him to come closer. The monk stepped forward, “Closer still,” said Bankei. The monk came forward again. “How well,” said Bankei, “you understand me!”15 In other words, our natural organism performs the most marvelously complex activities without the least hesitation or deliberation.
Conscious thought is itself founded upon its whole system of spontaneous functioning, for which reason there is really no alternative to trusting oneself completely to its working. Oneself is its working.*

**Joscha Bach mentioned that our universe is a combination of a dream and the pure underlying matter. In that dream miracles can happen, which is that matter can all of a sudden start talking. 

**Sometimes when I'm high I'm so amazed at people being able to understand what I mean when I'm making noises with my mouth towards them.

*It is often said that to be clinging to oneself is like having a thorn in the skin, and that Buddhism is a second thorn to extract the ?rst.
When it is out, both thorns are thrown away. But in the moment when Buddhism, when philosophy or religion, becomes another way of clinging to oneself through seeking a spiritual security, the two thorns become one–and how is it to be taken out? This, as Bankei said, is “wiping o? blood with blood.” Therefore in Zen there is neither self nor Buddha to which one can cling, no good to gain and no evil to be avoided, no thoughts to be eradicated and no mind to be puri?ed, no body to perish and no soul to be saved. At one blow this entire framework of abstractions is shattered to fragments. As the Zenrin says:
To save life it must be destroyed.
When utterly destroyed, one dwells for the ?rst time in peace.8*

**What then are all the monks still doing in the monastery?

*rid of obstacles to the free flow of thought from the “unconscious.” For there is a tendency to confuse “blocking”–a purely obstructive mechanism–with thinking out an answer, but the di?erence between the two is easily noticed in such a purely “thinking out” process as adding a column of ?gures. Many people ?nd that at certain combinations of numbers, such as 8 and 5 or 7 Because it is always annoying and disconcerting, one tends also to block at blocking, so that the state turns into the kind of wobbling dither characteristic of the snarled feed-back system. The simplest cure is to feel free to block, so that one does not block at blocking.
When one feels free to block, the blocking automatically eliminates itself. It is like riding a bicycle. When one starts falling to the left, one does not resist the fall (i.e., the block) by turning to the right.
One turns the wheel to the left–and the balance is restored. The principle here is, of course, the same as getting out of the contradiction of “trying to be spontaneous” through accepting the “trying” as “spontaneous,” through not resisting the block.*

**Comparing nonblocking to flow is not quite right. Nonblocking touches every possible state you can be in. If you're crying then sob. If you're angry then shout. If you're happy then smile. It's about full acceptance and non-attachment, to realize that it's futile to not be awakened.

*Whereas it might be supposed that the practice of Zen is a means to the end of awakening, this is not so. For the practice of Zen is not the true practice so long as it has an end in view, and when it has no end in view it is awakening–the aimless, self-su?cient life of the “eternal now.” To practice with an end in view is to have one eye on the practice and the other on the end, which is lack of concentration, lack of sincerity. To put it in another way: one does not practice Zen to become a Buddha; one practices it because one is a Buddha from the beginning–and this “original realization” is the starting point of the Zen life. Original realization is the “body” (t’i b) and the marvelous practice the “use” (yung c), and the two correspond respectively to prajna, wisdom, and karuna, the compassionate activity of the awakened Bodhisattva in the world of birth-and-death.*

**That explains why the monks are still in the monastery. They're busy being Buddha.

*The Western mentality feels that such things are not only unnatural but a great waste of valuable time, however useful as a discipline for inculcating patience and fortitude. Although the West has its own contemplative tradition in the Catholic Church, the life of “sitting and looking” has lost its appeal, for no religion is valued which does not “improve the world,” and it is hard to see how the world can be improved by keeping still. Yet it should be obvious that action without wisdom, without clear awareness of the world as it really is, can never improve anything. Furthermore, as muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone, it could be argued that those who sit quietly and do nothing are making one of the best possible contributions to a world in turmoil.*

**For certain complex issues, inaction is the only right choice.

*The relevance of za-zen to Zen is obvious when it is remembered that Zen is seeing reality directly, in its “suchness.” To see the world as it is concretely, undivided by categories and abstractions, one must certainly look at it with a mind which is not thinking–which is to say, forming symbols–about it. Za-zen is not, therefore, sitting with a blank mind which excludes all the impressions of the inner and outer senses. It is not “concentration” in the usual sense of restricting the attention to a single sense object, such as a point of light or the tip of one’s nose. It is simply a quiet awareness, without comment, of whatever happens to be here and now. This awareness is attended by the most vivid sensation of “nondi?erence” between the various sounds, sights, and other impressions of the surrounding environment. Naturally, this sensation does not arise by trying to acquire it; it just comes by itself when one is sitting and watching without any purpose in mind–even the purpose of getting rid of purpose.*

**It's really about just sitting. You will be swept up by the world and you don't need to do anything. Accept whatever comes or doesn't come.

*To know the answers without having so discovered them would be like studying the map without taking the journey. Lacking the actual shock of recognition, the bare answers seem ?at and disappointing, and obviously no competent master would be deceived by anyone who gave them without genuine feeling.*

**The answer is just the tip of the answer. The experiences and the learnings that led to being able to give that answer are the important things.

*All time is here in this body, which is the body of Buddha. The past exists in its memory and the future in its anticipation, and both of these are now, for when the world is inspected directly and clearly past and future times are nowhere to be found.
This is also the teaching of Bankei:
You are primarily Buddhas; you are not going to be Buddhas for the ?rst time. There is not an iota of a thing to be called error in your inborn mind.… If you have the least desire to be better than you actually are, if you hurry up to the slightest degree in search of something, you are already going against the Unborn.5*

**Dwelling on the past and anticipating the future are both tasks that are done in the present. To discard them is to seek. All of this is still naturalness, whatever you do is. You cannot help being empty and part of everything and being Buddha.

*To a young Zen monk the roshi therefore stands as a symbol of the utmost patriarchal authority, and he usually plays the role to perfection–being normally a man advanced in years, ?erce and “tigerish” in aspect, and, when formally robed and seated for the sanzen interview, a person of supreme presence and dignity. In this role he constitutes a living symbol of everything that makes one afraid of being spontaneous, everything that prompts the most painful and awkward self-consciousness. He assumes this role as an upaya, a skillful device, for challenging the student to ?nd enough “nerve” to be perfectly natural in the presence of this formidable archetype. If he can do this, he is a free man whom no one on earth can embarrass. It must be borne in mind, too, that in Japanese culture the adolescent and the youth are peculiarly susceptible to ridicule, which is freely used as a means of conforming the young to social convention.*

**I've always wondered what the point of the sterness of Eastern masters was about. For them to build themselves up as the greatest challenge that their pupil is meant to overcome is a great gift. If the student would know this beforehand it would defeat the purpose. Makes sense to not want to leak that information.

Page: 181

*Thus normal ?rst koan are Hui-neng’s “Original Face,” Chao-chou’s “Wu,” or Hakuin’s “One Hand.” At the ?rst sanzen interview, the roshi instructs the reluctantly accepted student to discover his “original face” or “aspect,” that is, his basic nature, as it was before his father and mother conceived him. He is told to return when he has discovered it, and to give some proof of discovery. In the meantime he is under no circumstance to discuss the problem with others or to seek their help. Joining the other monks in the sodo, the jikijitsu or “head monk” will probably instruct him in the rudiments of za-zen, showing him how to sit, and perhaps encouraging him to return to the roshi for sanzen as soon as possible, and to lose no opportunity for getting the proper view of his koan. Pondering the problem of his “original face,” he therefore tries and tries to imagine what he was before he was born, or, for that matter, what he now is at the very center of his being, what is the basic reality of his existence apart from his extension in time and space.
He soon discovers that the roshi has no patience whatever with philosophical or other wordy answers. For the roshi wants to be “shown.” He wants something concrete, some solid proof. The student therefore begins to produce such “specimens of reality” as lumps of rock, leaves and branches, shouts, gestures of the hands– anything and everything he can imagine. But all is resolutely rejected until the student, unable to imagine anything more, is brought to his wits’ end–at which point he is of course beginning to get on the right track. He “knows that he doesn’t know.”*

**It's learning by failure, the most deep kind of learning. It reminds me about aporia. 

---
Page: 183

*The continued practice of za-zen now provides the student with a clear, unobstructed mind into which he can toss the koan like a pebble into a pool and simply watch to see what his mind does with it.*

**The mind is no longer trying to tie itself in knots. Clarity and spontaneity.

Page: 185

*To say that the koan system has certain dangers or drawbacks is only to say that anything can be misused. It is a highly sophisticated and even institutionalized technique, and therefore lends itself to a?ectation and arti?ciality. But so does any technique, even when so untechnical as Bankei’s method of no method. This, too, can become a fetish. Yet it is important to be mindful of the points at which the drawbacks are most likely to arise, and it would seem that in koan training there are two.*

**Sometimes we think we can escape by obscuring techniques with reasons for why they're not artificial, but the layers of obscurity doesn't get you even a millimeter closer. Security by obscurity is equivalent to no security.

*Awakening almost necessarily involves a sense of relief because it brings to an end the habitual psychological cramp of trying to grasp the mind with the mind, which in turn generates the ego with all its con?icts and defenses. In time, the sense of relief wears o?–but not the awakening, unless one has confused it with the sense of relief and has attempted to exploit it by indulging in ecstasy. Awakening is thus only incidentally pleasant or ecstatic, only at ?rst an experience of intense emotional release. But in itself it is just the ending of an arti?cial and absurd use of the mind. Above and beyond that it is wu-shih–nothing special–since the ultimate content of awakening is never a particular object of knowledge or experience. The Buddhist doctrine of the “Four Invisibles” is that the Void (sunya) is to a Buddha as water to a ?sh, air to a man, and the nature of things to the deluded–beyond conception.*

**What does it feel like to awaken and be awake?

---
Page: 186

*It should be obvious that what we are, most substantially and fundamentally, will never be a distinct object of knowledge.
Whatever we can know–life and death, light and darkness, solid and empty–will be the relative aspects of something as inconceivable as the color of space. Awakening is not to know what this reality is. As a Zenrin poem says:
As butterflies come to the newly planted flowers, Bodhidharma says, “I know not.” g Awakening is to know what reality is not. It is to cease identifying oneself with any object of knowledge whatsoever. Just as every assertion about the basic substance or energy of reality must be meaningless, any assertion as to what “I am” at the very roots of my being must also be the height of folly. Delusion is the false metaphysical premise at the root of common sense; it is the average man’s unconscious ontology and epistemology, his tacit assumption that he is a “something.” The assumption that “I am nothing” would, of course, be equally wrong since something and nothing, being and non-being, are related concepts, and belong equally to the “known.”*

**You can never see reality for what it is, there's nothing that can be conceptualized. But you can see what reality is not. You can see all falsities.

*From this standpoint Bankei’s simple trust in the “Unborn mind” and even Shinran’s view of Nembutsu are also entrances to satori.
To “let go” it is not always necessary to wear out the attempt to grasp until it becomes intolerable. As against this violent way there is also a judo–a. “gentle way,” the way of seeing that the mind, the basic reality, remains spontaneous and ungrasped whether one tries to grasp it or not. One’s own doing or not doing drop away by sheer irrelevance. To think that one must grasp or not grasp, let go or not let go, is only to foster the illusion that the ego is real, and that its machinations are an e?ective obstacle to the Tao. Beside the spontaneous functioning of the “Unborn mind” these e?orts or non-e?orts are strictly null. In the more imagistic language of Shinran, one has only to hear of the “saving vow” of Amitabha and to say his Name, the Nembutsu, even just once without concern as to whether one has faith or not, or as to whether one is desireless or not. All such concern is the pride of the ego. In the words of the Shin-shu mystic Kichi-bei:
When all the idea of self-power based upon moral values and disciplinary measures is purged, there is nothing left in you that will declare itself to be the hearer, and just because of this you do not miss anything you hear.16 So long as one thinks about listening, one cannot hear clearly, and so long as one thinks about trying or not trying to let go of oneself, one cannot let go. Yet whether one thinks about listening or not, the ears are hearing just the same, and nothing can stop the sound from reaching them.*

**There is no listener, there is no seer, there is no witness. There's no way not to be natural. All your flaws and artificial behaviors are part of the way. However the false conceptions you have about yourself can tie themselves into knots and create situations that you think are painful and cause suffering. You can let that part rest when you realize its all void, all beyond unknowable. For to be unknowable implies that there are knowable things.

*The art forms of the Western world arise from spiritual and philosophical traditions in which spirit is divided from nature, and comes down from heaven to work upon it as an intelligent energy upon an inert and recalcitrant stu?. Thus Malraux speaks always of the artist “conquering” his medium as our explorers and scientists also speak of conquering mountains or conquering space. To Chinese and Japanese ears these are grotesque expressions. For when you climb it is the mountain as much as your own legs which lifts you upwards, and when you paint it is the brush, ink, and paper which determine the result as much as your own hand.*

**Different aesthetics give people completely different ways of viewing the world. I appreciate the eastern gratitude for everything around them, a humility.

*Paradoxical as it may seem, the purposeful life has no content, no point. It hurries on and on, and misses everything. Not hurrying, the purposeless life misses nothing, for it is only when there is no goal and no rush that the human senses are fully open to receive the world. Absence of hurry also involves a certain lack of interference with the natural course of events, especially when it is felt that the natural course follows principles which are not foreign to human intelligence. For, as we have seen, the Taoist mentality makes, or forces, nothing but “grows” everything. When human reason is seen to be an expression of the same spontaneous balance of yang and yin as the natural universe, man’s action upon his environment is not felt as a con?ict, an action from outside. Thus the di?erence between forcing and growing cannot be expressed in terms of speci?c directions as to what should or should not be done, for the difference lies primarily in the quality and feeling of the action. The di?culty of describing these things for Western ears is that people in a hurry cannot feel.*

**Non-objective search has these kinds of vibes. I've felt it myself, when I think that I need to hurry to get somewhere everything turns into a feeling less blur. What I do think you need to put some energy into is to put yourself out there, give the world a voice to call you with. It's very easy to isolate yourself and become deaf to the world's voice.

*One of the most striking features of the Sung landscape, as of sumi-e as a whole, is the relative emptiness of the picture–an emptiness which appears, however, to be part of the painting and not just unpainted background. By ?lling in just one corner, the artist makes the whole area of the picture alive. Ma-yüan, in particular, was a master of this technique, which amounts almost to “painting by not painting,” or what Zen sometimes calls “playing the string-less lute.” The secret lies in knowing how to balance form with emptiness and, above all, in knowing when one has “said” enough. For Zen spoils neither the aesthetic shock nor the satori shock by ?lling in, by explanation, second thoughts, and intellectual commentary.
Furthermore, the ?gure so integrally related to its empty space gives the feeling of the “marvelous Void” from which the event suddenly appears.*

**It is to make the silence feel louder than any sound.

*The Western eye is immediately struck by the absence of symmetry in these paintings, by the consistent avoidance of regular and geometrical shapes, whether straight or curved. For the characteristic brush line is jagged, gnarled, irregularly twisting, dashing, or sweeping–always spontaneous rather than predictable.
Even when the Zen monk or artist draws a solitary circle-one of the most common themes of zenga–it is not only slightly eccentric and with the incidental splashes and gaps of the “rough brush.” For the abstract or “perfect” circle becomes concrete and natural–a living circle–and, in the same way, rocks and trees, clouds and waters appear to the Chinese eye as most like themselves when most unlike the intelligible forms of the geometer and architect.*

**Organic patterns are for some reason more beautiful and soothing to observe. The same goes for the pattern of life. 

---
Page: 197

*Thus the aimless life is the constant theme of Zen art of every kind, expressing the artist’s own inner state of going nowhere in a timeless moment. All men have these moments occasionally, and it is just then that they catch those vivid glimpses of the world which cast such a glow over the intervening wastes of memory–the smell of burning leaves on a morning of autumn haze, a ?ight of sunlit pigeons against a thundercloud, the sound of an unseen waterfall at dusk, or the single cry of some unidenti?ed bird in the depths of a forest. In the art of Zen every landscape, every sketch of bamboo in the wind or of lonely rocks, is an echo of such moments.*

**We lose ourselves in what we observe all the time. We're replaced by what we observe just for a little while.

*But the non-Japanese listener must remember that a good haiku is a pebble thrown into the pool of the listener’s mind, evoking associations out of the richness of his own memory. It invites the listener to participate instead of leaving him dumb with admiration while the poet shows off.*

*Sabi is, however, loneliness in the sense of Buddhist detachment, of seeing all things as happening “by themselves” in miraculous spontaneity. With this goes that sense of deep, illimitable quietude which descends with a long fall of snow, swallowing all sounds in layer upon layer of softness.*

*Aware is the moment of crisis between seeing the transience of the world with sorrow and regret, and seeing it as the very form of the Great Void.*

**Even in anime it's quite clear that Japan is well-versed in transient concepts. Sakura blossom might be the most popular symbol for it. There's always a letting go and a feeling of gratitude and the gratitude is the reflection of grief in the mirror of the great void.

*If Christianity is wine and Islam co?ee, Buddhism is most certainly tea. Its quietening, clarifying, and slightly bitter taste gives it almost the same taste as awakening itself, though the bitterness corresponds to the pleasing roughness of “natural texture,” and the “middle path” between sweet and sour. Long before the development of cha-no-yu, tea was used by Zen monks as a stimulant for meditation, and in this context it was drunk in a mood of unhurried awareness which naturally lent itself to a ritualistic type of action. In summer it refreshed and in winter warmed those wandering hermit-monks who liked to build grass and bamboo huts in the mountain forests, or by rock-?lled streams in the gorges.*

**If you were a drink, what drink would you be?

*After the tea has been drunk, the guests may ask to inspect all the utensils which have been used, since every one of them has been made or chosen with the utmost care, and often brought out for the occasion because of some feature that would particularly appeal to one of the guests.
Every appurtenance of the cha-no-yu has been selected in accordance with canons of taste over which the most sensitive men in Japan have brooded for centuries. Though the choice is usually intuitive, careful measurement of the objects reveals interesting and unexpected proportions–works of spontaneous geometry as remarkable as the spiral shell of the nautilus or the structure of the snow crystal.*

**The depth of detail is very organic and alive.

*A few, perhaps, ?nd the secret of bringing the two worlds together, of seeing the “hard realities” of human life to be the same aimless working of the Tao as the patterns of branches against the sky. In the words of Hung Tzu-ch’eng:
If the mind is not overlaid with wind and waves, you will always be living among blue mountains and green trees. If your true nature has the creative force of Nature itself, wherever you may go, you will see fishes leaping and geese flying.*

**There is no duality, there is no awakened state of being as opposed to a non-awakened state of being.

*The Zen gardener has no mind to impose his own intention upon natural forms, but is careful rather to follow the “intentionless intention” of the forms themselves, even though this involves the utmost care and skill. In fact the gardener never ceases to prune, clip, weed, and train his plants, but he does so in the spirit of being part of the garden himself rather than a directing agent standing outside. He is not interfering with nature because he is nature, and he cultivates as if not cultivating. Thus the garden is at once highly arti?cial and extremely natural!*

**Can this be applied to leadership as well?

*His master at one and the same time urged him to keep on working and working, but also to stop making an e?ort. For the art cannot be learned unless the arrow “shoots itself,” unless the string is released wu-hsin and wu-nien, without “mind” and without blocking, or “choice.”
After all those years of practice there came a day when it just happened–how, or why, Herrigel never understood.
The same is true in learning to use the brush for writing or painting. The brush must draw by itself. This cannot happen if one does not practice constantly. But neither can it happen if one makes an e?ort. Similarly, in swordsmanship one must not ?rst decide upon a certain thrust and then attempt to make it, since by that time it will be too late. Decision and action must be simultaneous.*

**Hone your intentional technique to perfection then start playing and let your mind and body move spontaneously.

*The sudden visions of nature which form the substance of haiku them. The artificial haiku always feels like a piece of life which has been deliberately broken o? or wrenched away from the universe, whereas the genuine haiku has dropped o? all by itself, and has the whole universe inside it.*

**This might be the difference between writing a story and discovering a story. In order to discover a story your technique must be flawless because otherwise you'll need to make conscious effort. Similar to how when you learn how to drive, you do every action consciously and it's very slow and inefficient and your driving is awful because of it. When you're able to drive unconsciously it makes all the difference.

*By all quantitative standards the work so contrived is indistinguishable from its models, just as bowmen and swordsmen trained by quite other methods can equal the feats of Zen-inspired samurai. But, so far as Zen is concerned, the end results have nothing to do with it. For, as we have seen all along, Zen has no goal; it is a traveling without point, with nowhere to go. To travel is to be alive, but to get somewhere is to be dead, for as our own proverb says, “To travel well is better than to arrive.”*

**It's a deep fake versus the real thing. The deep fake has no inside.

*Planned surprises are as much of a contradiction as intentional satori, and whoever aims at satori is after all like a person who sends himself Christmas presents for fear that others will forget him.
One must simply face the fact that Zen is all that side of life which is completely beyond our control, and which will not come to us by any amount of forcing or wangling or cunning–stratagems which an absolute dualism–the rather barren world of controlled action on the one side, and the spontaneous world of uncontrolled surprise on the other. For who controls the controller?*

**A planned surprise is like welcoming the breath.

*In its own way, each one of the arts which Zen has inspired gives vivid expression to the sudden or instantaneous quality of its view of the world. The momentariness of sumi paintings and haiku, and the total presence of mind required in cha-no-yu and kendo, bring out the real reason why Zen has always called itself the way of instantaneous awakening. It is not just that satori comes quickly and unexpectedly, all of a sudden, for mere speed has nothing to do with it. The reason is that Zen is a liberation from time. For if we open our eyes and see clearly, it becomes obvious that there is no other time than this instant, and that the past and the future are abstractions without any concrete reality.
Until this has become clear, it seems that our life is all past and future, and that the present is nothing more than the in?nitesimal hairline which divides them. From this comes the sensation of “having no time,” of a world which hurries by so rapidly that it is gone before we can enjoy it. But through “awakening to the instant” one sees that this is the reverse of the truth: it is rather the past and future which are the ?eeting illusions, and the present which is convention of our single-track verbal thinking, of a consciousness which interprets the world by grasping little pieces of it, calling them things and events. But every such grasp of the mind excludes the rest of the world, so that this type of consciousness can get an approximate vision of the whole only through a series of grasps, one after another. Yet the super?ciality of this consciousness is seen in the fact that it cannot and does not regulate even the human organism. For if it had to control the heartbeat, the breath, the operation of the nerves, glands, muscles, and sense organs, it would be rushing wildly around the body taking care of one thing after another, with no time to do anything else. Happily, it is not in charge, and the organism is regulated by the timeless “original mind,” which deals with life in its totality and so can do ever so many “things” at once.
However, it is not as if the super?cial consciousness were one thing, and the “original mind” another, for the former is a specialized activity of the latter. Thus the super?cial consciousness can awaken to the eternal present if it stops grasping. But this does not come to pass by trying to concentrate on the present–an e?ort which succeeds only in making the moment seem ever more elusive and fleeting, ever more impossible to bring into focus. Awareness of the “eternal now” comes about by the same principle as the clarity of hearing and seeing and the proper freedom of the breath. Clear sight has nothing to do with trying to see; it is just the realization that the eyes will take in every detail all by themselves, for so long as they are open one can hardly prevent the light from reaching them. In the same way, there is no di?culty in being fully aware of the eternal present as soon as it is seen that one cannot possibly be aware of anything else–that in concrete fact there is no past or future. Making an e?ort to concentrate on the instantaneous moment implies at once that there are other moments. But they are nowhere to be found, and in truth one rests as easily in the eternal present as the eyes and ears respond to light and sound.
Now this eternal present is the “timeless,” unhurried ?owing of the Tao– Such a tide as, moving, seems to sleep, Too full for sound or foam.
As Nan-ch’üan said, to try to accord with it is to deviate from it, though in fact one cannot deviate and there is no one to deviate. So, too, one cannot get away from the eternal present by trying to attend to it, and this very fact shows that, apart from this present, there is no distinct self that watches and knows it-which is why Hui-k’o could not ?nd his mind when Bodhidharma asked him to produce it. However puzzling this may be, and however many philosophical problems it may raise, one clear look is enough to show its unavoidable truth. There is only this now. It does not come from anywhere; it is not going anywhere. It is not permanent, but it is not impermanent. Though moving, it is always still. When we try to catch it, it seems to run away, and yet it is always here and there is no escape from it. And when we turn round to find the self which knows this moment, we ?nd that it has vanished like the past.*

**Grasping it goes against it. But grasping itself is part of it. There's nothing outside of it or inside of it. Being awakened is as seeing with your eyes and hearing with your ears. It just happens. This moment just is. There's nothing to grasp or understand. There is no present because there's no past or future, every moment just is.
