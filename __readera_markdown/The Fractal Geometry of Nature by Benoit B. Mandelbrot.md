*Nevertheless, this Essay avoids all purely technical difficulties. It is addressed primarily to a mixed group of scientists. The presentation of each theme begins with concrete and specific cases. The nature of fractals is meant to be gradually discovered by the reader, not revealed in a flash by the author.And the art can be enjoyed for itself.*

**All good math is born from the concrete.

*“It must be borne in mind that, although closer observation of any object generally leads to the discovery of a highly irregular structure, we often can with advantage approximate its properties by continuous functions. Although wood may be indefinitely porous, it is useful to speak of a beam that has been sawed and planed as having a finite area. In other words, at certain scales and for certain methods of investigation, many phenomena may be represented by regular continuous functions, somewhat in the same way that a sheet of tinfoil may be wrapped round a sponge without following accurately the latter’s complicated contour.“If, to go further, we... attribute to matter the infinitely granular structure that is in the spirit of atomic theory, our power to apply to reality the rigorous mathematical concept of continuity will greatly decrease.*

**If we don't coarse grain our mathematical abstractions loses their efficiency and generality. We'd be going too specific and thus only make the calculation applicable to the specific case.

*A principal aim of this Essay will be to show that the loose notion of dimension splits into several distinct components. The Brownian motion’s trail is topologically a curve, of dimension 1. However, being practically plane filling, it is fractally of dimension 2. The discrepancy between these two values will, in the terminology introduced in this Essay, qualify Brownian motion as being a fractal.*

**Geoffrey West makes use of this notion of fractal dimensions to explain superlinear and sublinear effects of scaling.

*This Essay shares Perrin’s concern, but attacks irregularity from a different angle. We stress the fact that when a Brownian trajectory is examined increasingly closely, Chapter 25, its length increases without bound.*

**That's why you can't measure something without also saying what level of granularity is.

*Mathematicians recognized during their 1875-1925 crisis that a proper understanding of irregularity or fragmentation (as of regularity and connectedness) cannot be satisfied with defining dimension as a number of coordinates. The first step of a rigorous analysis is taken by Cantor in his June 20, 1877, letter to Dedekind, the next step by Peano in 1890, and the final steps in the 1920’s.*

**I did not know there was ambiguity in dimensions.

*A fractal is by definition a set for which the Hausdorff Besicovitch dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension.*

**I'm missing a lot of definitions that are taken for granted.

*And that the topological dimension is the same for coastlines and circles: equal to 1. If one adds offshore “satellite islands,” the cumulative coastline is topologically identical to “many” circles. Thus, topology fails to discriminate between different coastlines.By way of contrast, Chapter 5 shows that different coastlines tend to have different fractal dimensions. Differences in fractal dimension express differences in a nontopological aspect of form, which I propose to call fractal form.Most problems of real interest combine fractal and topological features in increasingly subtle fashion.*

**I hadn't thought of topology as inadequate to describe certain surfaces and dimensions but given the coastline example it's easy to see that it is. Adding the fractal dimension let's us describe reality without coarse graining it.

*Effective dimension concerns the relation between mathematical sets and natural objects. Strictly speaking, physical objects such as a veil, a thread, or a tiny ball should all be represented by three-dimensional shapes. However, physicists prefer to think of a veil, a thread, or a ball—if they are fine enough—as being “in effect” of dimensions 2, 1, and 0, respectively. For example, to describe a thread, the theories relating to sets of dimension 1 or 3 must be modified by corrective terms. And the better geometrical model is determined after the fact, as involving the smaller corrections. If luck holds, this model continues to be helpful even when corrections are omitted. In other words, effective dimension inevitably has a subjective basis. It is a matter of approximation and therefore of degree of resolution.*

**Finally found a word for this! I've always been uncomfortable with saying that paper is two-dimensional, etc. Nothing in this world isn't three-dimensional, but I can see the use of thinking of them as being something else, I.e. considering their effective dimension as something else.

*To confirm this last hunch, a ball of 10 cm diameter made of a thick thread of 1 mm diameter possesses (in latent fashion) several distinct effective dimensions.To an observer placed far away, the ball appears as a zero-dimensional figure: a point. (Anyhow, it is asserted by Blaise Pascal and by medieval philosophers that on a cosmic scale our whole world is but a point!) As seen from a distance of 10 cm resolution, the ball of thread is a three-dimensional figure. At 10 mm, it is a mess of one-dimensional threads. At 0.1 mm, each thread becomes a column and the whole becomes a three-dimensional figure again. At 0.01 mm, each column dissolves into fibers, and the ball again becomes one-dimensional, and so on, with the dimension crossing over repeatedly from one value to another. When the ball is represented by a finite number of atomlike pinpoints, it becomes zero-dimensional again. An analogous sequence of dimensions and crossovers is encountered in a sheet of paper.The notion that a numerical result should depend on the relation of object to observer is in the spirit of physics in this century and is even an exemplary illustration of it.Most of the objects considered in this Essay are like our ball of thread: they exhibit a succession of different effective dimensions. But a vital new element is added: certain ill-defined transitions between zones of well-defined dimension are reinterpreted as being fractal zones within which D>DT.*

**I love this way of thinking about it. What is the lowest and highest resolution of reality? If we zoom out to the furthest point in the universe what does things look like? If we zoom in  as close as physically possible on a quark, what do we see?

*Furthermore, most fractals in this Essay are invariant under certain transformations of scale. They are called scaling. A fractal invariant under ordinary geometric similarity is called self-similar.In the compound term scaling fractals, the adjective serves to mitigate the noun. While the primary term fractal points to disorder and covers cases of intractable irregularity, the modifier scaling points to a kind of order. Alternatively, taking scaling as the primary term pointing to strict order, fractal is a modifier meant to exclude lines and planes.*

**It's lovely to see how different mathematical spaces are able to reuse concepts, though reshaping their semantics.

**So scaling fractals are like the base components. What does a non self-similar fractal look like?

*that nature’s “fundamental laws do not govern the world as it appears in our mental picture in any very direct way, but instead they control a substratum of which we cannot form a mental picture without introducing irrelevancies.”The wide and uncritical acceptance of this view has become destructive. In particular, in the theory of fractals “to see is to believe.” Therefore, before he proceeds further, the reader is again advised to browse through my picture book. This Essay was designed to help make its contents accessible in various degrees to a wide range of readers, and to try and convince even the purest among mathematicians that the understanding of known concepts and the search for new concepts and conjectures are both helped by fine graphics. Rarely does contemporary scientific literature show such trust in the usefulness of graphics.*

**To ignore one of our primary mental tools, namely visualization, seems misguided. I'm glad to hear that the author endorses the use of it for generating understanding and insight.

*The fractal “new geometric art” shows surprising kinship to Grand Masters paintings or Beaux Arts architecture. An obvious reason is that classical visual arts, like fractals, involve very many scales of length and favor self-similarity (Mandelbrot 19811). For all these reasons, and also because it came in through an effort to imitate Nature in order to guess its laws, it may well be that fractal art is readily accepted because it is not truly unfamiliar. Abstract paintings vary on this account: those I like also tend to be close to fractal geometric art, but many are closer to standard geometric art—too close for my own comfort and enjoyment.*

**Pure fractals are pretty uninteresting but when you weave it in appropriately it makes the art richer.

*The second and more significant reason against deciding on an arbitrary ϵ is philosophical and scientific. Nature does exist apart from Man, and anyone who gives too much weight to any specific ϵ and L(ϵ) lets the study of Nature be dominated by Man, either through his typical yardstick size or his highly variable technical reach. If coastlines are ever to become an object of scientific inquiry, the uncertainty concerning their lengths cannot be legislated away. In one manner or another, the concept of geographic length is not as inoffensive as it seems. It is not entirely “objective.” The observer inevitably intervenes in its definition.*

**It's interesting that something so simple as measuring the length of something physical is subject to such arbitrariness. 

---
Page: 86

*To summarize the preceding section, the main finding is always the same. As ϵ is made smaller and smaller, every approximate length tends to increase steadily without bound.*

**What happens if you go down to Plank scales? At the physical limit of distance, what happens there?

*“The great field for new discoveries ... is always the unclassified residuum. Round about the accredited and orderly facts of every science there ever floats a sort of dust-cloud of exceptional observations, of occurrences minute and irregular and seldom met with, which it always proves more easy to ignore than to attend to. The ideal of every science is that of a closed and completed system of truth ... Phenomena unclassifiable within the system are paradoxical absurdities, and must be held untrue ... —one neglects or denies them with the best of scientific consciences... Any one will renovate his science who will steadily look after the irregular phenomena. And when the science is renewed, its new formulas often have more of the voice of the exception in them than of what were supposed to be the rules.”*

**What are the things different fields conveniently hide under their rugs? Anomalies has always been more interesting to than regularity.

*These voices had not been heard, however. Not only near every book but every science museum proclaims that nondifferentiable curves are counter-intuitive, “monstrous,” “pathological,” or even “psychopathic.”*

**As soon as you see a monster in science, that should make you very intrigued.
