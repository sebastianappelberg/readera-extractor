*A beautiful or noble deed is a deed to be praised. Courage does what is to be praised and rejects what is to be de- spised. One praises that in which a being fulfills its po- tentialities or actualizes its perfections. Courage is the affirmation of one’s essential nature, one’s inner aim or entelechy, but it is an affirmation which has in itself the character of “in spite of.” It includes the possible and, in some cases, the unavoidable sacrifice of elements which also belong to one’s being but which, if not sacrificed, Courage and Fortitude: Plato to Aquinas 5 would prevent us from reaching our actual fulfillment. 
This sacrifice may include pleasure, happiness, even one’s own existence. In any case it is praiseworthy, because in the act of courage the most essential part of our being prevails against the less essential. It is the beauty and goodness of courage that the good and.the beautiful are actualized in it. Therefore it is noble.*

**In this sense we can feel what courage is whenever we do something that feels right and whenever we don't do something that feels wrong, no matter the circumstance. To see it as part of the refinement process of ourselves is cool. The parts of ourselves that have to die in order for the nobler parts to live, the sacrifice of those is noble. Changing takes courage. Reminds me of houseki no ko.
