one the city of the poor,
the other of the rich.

*Certainly old age has
a great sense of calm and freedom;
when the passions relax their hold,
then, as Sophocles says,
we are freed from the grasp
not of one mad master only,
but of many. The truth is, Socrates,
that these regrets, and also the
complaints about relations,
are to be attributed to the same cause,
which is not old age, but men's
characters and tempers;
for he who is of a calm
and happy nature will hardly feel
the pressure of age,
but to him who is of
opposite disposition
youth and age are equally a burden.*

**What does he mean by passions relaxing their hold? Does he mean sexual urges? 

---
Page: 15

*Courage is a kind of salvation.
Courage is knowing what not to fear.*

**Courage as knowledge is directly from Socrates. There are so many things that we overestimate and fear for no reason. I wonder if there are a lot of things we don't fear that we should. I do think the balance is towards the former simply because of its evolutionary advantages. 

---

that accords with his nature.*

**How do you know what accords with your nature?

---
Page: 17

*Either never, or very seldom,
do the quiet actions in life
appear to be better than the
quick and energetic ones.*

**What are the quiet actions? What are the quick and energetic actions? What does he mean appear better? Is it that we don't give the quiet ones enough credit?

---
Page: 17

*Evil is the vulgar lover who loves the
body rather than the soul,
inasmuch as he is not even stable,
because he loves a thing
which is in itself unstable,
and therefore when the bloom of youth
which he was desiring is over,
he takes wing and flies away,
in spite of all his words and promises;
whereas the love of the
noble disposition is life-long,
for it becomes one with the everlasting.*

**Is he personifying an attribute of a part of the self?

remembers that
God is always looking upon him*

---

from vigorous natures perverted by
upbringing; a weak nature never does

---
Page: 21

without knowledge is always a poor
thing? At the best it is blind—isn't
anyone who holds a true opinion
without understanding
like a blind man on the right road?*

---
Page: 22

for I do not think it is
permitted that a better man
be harmed by a worse*

him who lives justice and holiness,
and is the nurse of his age and the

hope which is mightiest to sway
the restless soul of man.*

a small child wandering upon
the vast shores of knowledge,

---
Page: 26

*I must go beyond the dark world of
sense information to
the clear brilliance of
the sunlight of the outside world.
Once done, it becomes my duty to go

music, physics, and philosophy;

Page: 28

*If people despise money
when young, but grow to love
it more and more as
they grow older and no longer
devote themselves to excellence
as the best guardian,
the power of reasoned,
educated speech, leaves them.*

---
Page: 28

*If a man says that it is right
to give everyone his due,
and therefore thinks
within his own mind that
injury is due from a just man
to his enemies but kindness to his
friends, he was not wise who said so,

for in no case has it appeared
to be just to injure any one.*

**This is the basis of breaking evil spirals. 

---
Page: 28

*If a person does not attend
to the meaning of terms
as they are commonly
used in argument,
he may be involved
even in greater paradoxes.*

**Primarily what arises is the issue of equivocation. 

---
Page: 30

*They master certain pleasures
because they are mastered by others,
I fear this is not the right exchange
to attain virtue, to
exchange pleasures for pleasures,
pains for pains, and fears for fears,
the greater for the less like coins,
but that they only valid currency for
which all these things should
be exchanged is wisdom.*

---
Page: 31

God provided him with two means,
education and physical activity.
Not separately, one for the
soul and the other for the body,
but for the two together.

---
Page: 32

*In practice people who
study philosophy too long
become very odd birds,
not to say thoroughly vicious; while even
those who are the best of them are
reduced by. philosophy to complete
uselessness as members of society.*

---
Page: 32

*Is there anything worse for a state than
to be split and disunited? or
better than cohesion and unity?*

**Does he mean this entirely abstractly? In that case I believe there are many cases where splitting is desirable. Parent to child is a kind of splitting, it's the basis of life. Actual splitting is how many lifeforms procreate. 

---
Page: 32

*It behooves those who take the young to
task to leave them room for excuse, lest
they drive them to be hardened
by too much rebuke.*

**How much room is too much? At what point do they get worse for having not been hardened at all?

---
Page: 33

*It is a common saying, and in
everybody's mouth, that life is but a
sojourn. The learning and knowledge
that we have, is, at the most, but little
compared with that of
which we are ignorant.*

**What is the difference? How much will be unknown to me?

---
Page: 33

*It is impossible to improve the world if
first the man does not improve.*

**Cultural awakening has to happen bottom up. If you want to create a sustainable revolution you need to work on the storytelling and how to change people's way of thinking. 

---
Page: 33

*It is the task of the enlightened
not only to ascend to learning
and to see the good
but to be willing to descend again to
those prisoners and to share their
troubles and their honors, whether they
are worth having or not.
And this they must do, even with
the prospect of death.*

**In the heroes journey the return is an important part. But why? It's to nudge the rest of humanity in the right direction. Humanity as a whole is the ground that we all stand on, it's for the best of you and everyone that it keeps on progressing. 

---
Page: 34

*It would be better for me  that
multitudes of men should
disagree with me rather than
that I, being one, should
be out of harmony with myself.*

**Fighting external pressure, or rather, conquering it is a worthy goal. Why? Because groups are eager to shove the craziest parts of themselves down people's throats.

---
Page: 34

*It's not at all uncommon to find a
person's desires compelling
him to go against his reason,
and to see him cursing himself and
venting his passion
on the source of the
compulsion within him.
It's as if there
were two warring factions,
with passion fighting
on the side of reason.*

**Then what is fighting on the side of desires? 

---
Page: 35

*Justice will only exist
where those not affected
by injustice are filled with the
same amount of indignation
as those offended.*

**The enforcement of justice requires the participation of the group. 

---
Page: 35

*Just as it would be madness to
settle on medical treatment
for the body of a person
by taking an opinion poll of the
neighbors, so it is irrational
to prescribe for the body politic by
polling the opinions
of the people at large.*

**Interesting, he would not be in favor of direct democracy I take it. What is he pointing at? Perhaps that people are voting on issues that they don't know anything about.

---
Page: 35

*You are young, my son,
and, as the years go by,
time will change and even reverse
many of your present opinions.
Refrain therefore awhile
from setting yourself up as a judge
of the highest matters.*

**Embrace fallibalism,

---
Page: 37

*Let nobody speak mischief of anybody.*

**Talking shit about people truly is like small needlepricks to the soul.

---
Page: 37

*Life is a short exile*

**Exile from what? When we wake up, what happens then?

---
Page: 37

*Love is a madness produced by an
unclassifiable rational desire to
understand the ultimate
truth about the world.*

**The Greeks had many different types of love. Which type is he referring to here? What is that desire? It seems built in. 

---
Page: 38

*Love is born into every human being; it
calls back the halves of our original
nature together; it tries to make one out
of two and heal the wound
of human nature.*

**Non-dualism?

---
Page: 38

*Love is simply the name for the desire
and pursuit of the whole.*

**Love surely has a pursuit component to it, but is that all?

---
Page: 39

*Man...is a tame or civilized animal;
never the less, he requires proper
instruction and a fortunate nature, and
then of all animals he becomes the most
divine and most civilized; but if he be
insufficiently or ill- educated he is the
most savage of earthly creatures.*

**Our range is broad, we can do the kindest things and we can do the most horrific things. 

---
Page: 38

*Lust is inseparably accompanied with
the troubling of all order, with
impudence, unseemliness,
sloth, and dissoluteness.*

**Lust is a good differentiator from desire. Lust is the undesirable version. 

---
Page: 39

*Mankind will never see an end of trouble
until lovers of wisdom come to hold
political power, or the holders of power
become lovers of wisdom*

**The problem with that is that most people who love wisdom don't care for power. 

---
Page: 40

*Music then is simply
the result of the effects of Love
on rhythm and harmony.*

**Is he equating love to creativity and perhaps some sort of relevance realization? 

---
Page: 40

*Men say that everyone is
naturally a lover of himself,
and that it is right that it should be so.
This is a mistake; for in fact
the cause of all the blunders
committed by man arises from this
excessive self-love. For the lover is
blinded by the object loved,
so that he passes a wrong judgment
upon what is just, good, and beautiful,
thinking that he ought always
to honor what belongs to himself, in
preference to truth. For he who intends
to be a great man ought to love neither
himself nor his own things,
but only what is just,
whether it happens to be done by
himself or by another.*

**Being blinded by love for oneself is a matter of degree. All of which enhances confirmation bias and the like. 

---
Page: 41

*Music gives a soul to the universe, wings
to the mind, flight to the imagination, a
charm to sadness, gaiety and life to
everything. It is the essence of order,
and leads to all that is god, just, and
beautiful, of which it is the invisible,
but never less, dazzling,
passionate, and eternal form.*

**I've thought of music as just recreation whereas it seems more and more as if you can use it to enhance your creativity and spirituality. In what ways can you listen to music? How can you let it take you to special places?

---
Page: 42

*No human thing is
of serious importance.*

**Most of what we do in hindsight feels rather insignificant. 

---
Page: 42

*No intelligent man
will ever be so bold as to put into
language those things
which his reason has contemplated.*

**What does he mean by reason has contemplated? And why wouldn't it be put into words? Is it about the truths being too hard to explain properly?

---
Page: 43

*No one ever teaches well
who wants to teach, or governs well
who wants to govern.*

**This is certainly true. They easily become overbearing, and the skills necessary are seldom the skills we think are necessary. 

---
Page: 43

*No one is more hated than he who
speaks the truth.*

**People are very keen on maintaining illusions.

---
Page: 42

*No matter how hard
you fight the darkness,
every light casts a shadow,
and the closer you get to the light,
the darker that shadow becomes.*

**Kind of a non-dualist view of it.

---
Page: 43

*No one punishes the evil-doer under the
notion, or for the reason, that he has
done wrong. Only the unreasonable fury
of a beast acts in that way.
But he who desires to inflict rational
punishment does not retaliate
for a past wrong, for that
which is done cannot be undone,
but he has regard to
the future, and is desirous
that the man who is punished,
and he who sees him punished,
may be deterred from
doing wrong again.*

**Is punishment the proper way to correct a person's behavior? 

---
Page: 44

*Nothing in the affairs of men is worthy
of great anxiety.*

**Our worldly affairs are too insignificant to get anxiety over but at the same time so significant that you should love it with all your heart. 

---
Page: 44

*Our love for our children springs
from the soul's greatest
yearning for immortality.*

**That goes for intellectual children as well. 

---
Page: 44

*Opinion is the medium between
knowledge and ignorance.*

**Opinions really are bullshit most of the time. 

---
Page: 44

*No tools will make a man a skilled
workmen, or master of defense,
or be of any use to him who has not
learned how to handle them
and has never bestowed
any attention on them.*

**Spend time with your tools. Learn about them. That goes just as much for mental tools as physical ones. 

---
Page: 45

*Philosophers are the ones
who can reach what always stays the
same in every respect, and non-
philosophers the ones who cannot, who
wonder among the many things
that go in every direction.*

**Understanding the underlying generalities that govern the world. 

---
Page: 46

*Philosophy, Socrates, if pursued in
moderation and at the proper age, is an
elegant accomplishment, but too much
philosophy is the ruin of human life.*

**Why? Analysis paralysis? 

---
Page: 45

*Now actions vary according to the
manner of their performance.
Take, for example, that
which we are now doing, drinking,
singing and talking these actions
are not in themselves either
good or evil, but they turn out
in this or that way
according to the mode
of performing them; and
when well done they are good,
and when wrongly done they are
evil; and in like manner not every love,
but only that which has a noble purpose,
is noble and worthy of praise.*

**Anything you do can be done well or not so well. Doing things well is more fun. Having that said you'll need some practice, it's OK to be bad at something at first, in fact that's also fun. 

---
Page: 46

*Philosophy is an elegant thing, if anyone
modestly meddles with it, but if they are
conversant with it more than is
becoming, it corrupts them.*

**He constantly brings up the fact that philosophy wills destroy you. What does he actually mean? Does he mean that it prevents us from living and being? From participating? What does he mean by corrupt?

---
Page: 48

*Poets utter great and wise things which
they do not themselves understand.*

**Sometimes poets are just playing language games and sometimes they're just possessed by genius. 

---
Page: 48

*Prefer diligence before idleness, unless
you esteem rust above brightness.*

**I tend towards idleness, I'd want to be more diligent since it's how you get things around you and within you to grow. 

---
Page: 48

*States are as the men,
they grow out of human characters.*

**When we complain about the system, maybe we should take an extra look at ourselves? We're not fully responsible but we're not fully innocent either. 

---
Page: 49

*The desires of the worthless
many are controlled by
the desires and knowledge
of the decent few*

**A bit elitist no? However that wouldn't stop it from being true. 

---
Page: 49

*So when a man surrenders to the sound
of music and lets its sweet, soft,
mournful strains, which we have just
described, be funneled into his soul
through his ears, and gives up all his
time to the glamorous moanings of song,
the effect at first on his energy and
initiative of mind, if he has any, is to
soften it as iron is softened in a furnace,
and made workable instead of hard and
unworkable: but if he persists and does
not break the enchantment, the next
stage is that it melts and runs, till the
spirit has quite run out of him and his
mental sinews are cut.*

**So there's a balance to be found in the act of listening to music. How does one make use of the malleability gained from being absorbed by it? Can it be used for gaining insight into other problems? 

---
Page: 50

*That's what education should be ... the
art of orientation. Educators should
devise the simplest and most effective
methods of turning minds around. It
shouldn't be the art of implanting sight
in the organ, but should proceed on the
understanding that the organ already
has the capacity, but is improperly
aligned and isn't facing the right way.*

**Show don't tell applies for education too. It let's people bring their natural curiosity with them when learning. 

---
Page: 50

*The desire for sex turns
the penis into a disobedient thing
with a mind of its own.
Like an animal that will not listen
..it tries to take complete control.*

**Even great philosophers can lose control. 

---
Page: 51

*The excellence and righteousness
for each thing depend solely
on the use for which it was created.
This naturally means that
the user has the most experience
of it and must tell the
maker how it works best.*

**Plato the first product developer promoting user-centered design. 

---
Page: 51

*The excessive increase of
anything causes a reaction in
the opposite direction.*

**The beginning of understanding dynamic systems. Dynamic systems are at the core of life and society. 

---
Page: 51

*The good are like one another,
and friends to one another;
and ... the bad, as is often said of them,
are never at unity with one another
or with themselves, but
are passionate and restless:
and that which is at variance
and enmity with itself is not
likely to be in union or harmony
with any other thing.*

**If you're chaotic on the inside it'll be hard for you to care about anything else than trying to control yourself. 

---
Page: 52

*The greatest wealth
is to live content with little.*

**You can become wealthier and wealthier by just appreciating what you have more deeply every day. 

---
Page: 53

*The measure of a man is
what he does with power.*

**How would I act if I was the most powerful man in the world? If nobody could do anything against me?

---
Page: 54

*The philosopher whose dealings
are with divine order himself
acquires the characteristics
of order and divinity.*

**This is true of whatever you do. When we immerse ourselves in something we embody it in a strange way. 

---
Page: 54

*The more the pleasures
of the body fade away,
the greater to me is the pleasure and
charm of conversation.*

**It's worth investing in becoming good at conversation before you get there.

---
Page: 55

*The most virtuous are those
who content themselves
with being virtuous
without seeking to appear so.*

**Signaling your virtue is not virtuous. 

---
Page: 55

*The object of education is to teach us to
love what is beautiful.*

**Our aesthetics is our compass. It'll help us navigate uncharted territories much better than any specific directions.

---
Page: 55

*The partisan, when he is engaged in a
dispute, cares nothing about the
rights of the question, but is anxious
only to convince his hearers of
his own assertions.*

**Don't be a partisan. Be open-minded. Be there to learn not win. 

---
Page: 55

*The people always have some champion
whom they set over them
and nurse into greatness.
This and no other is the root
from which a tyrant springs;
when he first appears,
he is a protector.*

**This is the basis for the Strong Leader bias in tumultuous times. 

---
Page: 55

*The tools that would teach men their
own use would be beyond price.*

**What kind of tools is he talking about here? And does he mean the men's use or the tool's use? It's rather profound if it's the former. The only way seems to be a lifelong education. 

---
Page: 55

*The perfect state is one
where men weep and rejoice
over the same things.*

**A state where we're aligned on the ultimate good and the ultimate bad. 

---
Page: 56

*The plan grows under the author's hand;
new thoughts occur to him
in the act of writing;
he has not worked out the argument
to the end before he begins.*

**Writing is for this very reason a tool for thinking itself. Texts sometimes take on a life of their own and take you to unexpected places. 

---
Page: 56

*The point which I should
first wish to understand is
whether the pious or holy is beloved by the gods because it is holy,
or holy because it is beloved of the gods.*

**The gods is good rhetorical vehicle for explaining things. It somehow makes writing about the highest possible good a little less clunky. 

---
Page: 57

*The soul takes nothing with her to the
next world but her
education and her culture.
At the beginning of the journey to the
next world, one's education
and culture can either provide the
greatest assistance, or else act as the
greatest burden, to the person
who has just died.*

**What did education look like in their time? It seems like it was way more empowering than our educational system is.

---
Page: 57

*The souls of people, on their way to
Earth-life, pass through
a room full of lights;
each takes a taper,
often only a spark, to guide it in the
dim country of this world.
But some souls, by rare fortune,
are detained longer, have time to grasp
a handful of tapers, which they weave
into a torch. These are the torch-bearers
of humanity, its poets, seers, and saints,
who lead and lift the race out of
darkness, toward the light.
They are the law-givers and saviors,
the light-bringers,
way-showers and truth-tellers,
and without them, humanity would
lose its way in the dark.*

**What is it about certain people that makes them special? 

---
Page: 59

*The whole life of the philosopher
is a preparation for death.*

**Socrates faced his death with integrity. What does it mean to be ready when death comes?

*The true lover of knowledge naturally
strives for truth, and is not content with
common opinion, but soars with
undimmed and unwearied passion till
he grasps the essential nature of things.*

**Plato was big on first principles thinking.

*There are three arts
which are concerned
with all things.
One which uses,
another which makes,
and a third which imitates them.*

**I can sort of see what the use and make part means, but what does imitate mean in this context?

*There are two things a person
should never be angry at,
what they can help
and what they cannot.*

**You can see the kindling of stoicism in this quote.

*Those who don't know must
learn from those who do.*

**This highlights the importance of seeking out mentors.

*There can be no fairer spectacle than
that of a man, who combines the
possession of moral beauty in his soul
with the outward beauty of form,
corresponding and harmonizing with
the former, because the same great
pattern enters both.*

**When a person is fully aligned with themselves it's truly beautiful. Each movement is almost like being moved by the will of god.

*There is, in my view,
the birth of society that each of us,
far from being sufficient to itself,
on the contrary need
a large number of people*

**We're dependent on so much just for staying alive. Every thing in your room was probably created by a whole slew of people. There's an enormous supply chain behind something as trivial as your breakfast.

*There must always remain something
that is antagonistic to good.*

**Will we never transcend this notion? Can there be a conceptual worldview that doesn't include the opposites? I suppose recognizing that the opposites are part of the same is somehow that.

*This alone is to be feared:
the closed mind, the sleeping
imagination, the death of spirit.*

**People who end up here slowly but gradually rot.

*There's no chance of their having a
conscious glimpse of the truth as long as
they refuse to disturb the things they
take for granted and remain incapable of
explaining them. For if your starting
point is unknown, and your end-point
and intermediate stages are woven
together out of unknown material, there
may be coherence, but knowledge is
completely out of the question.*

**Question your assumptions. Build knowledge gradually from a solid base.

*This feeling of wonder
shows that you are a philosopher,
since wonder is the
only beginning of philosophy.*

**Doesn't everyone have some sort of sense of wonder for some things?

*This world is indeed a living being
endowed with a soul and intelligence ...
a single visible living entity
containing all other living entities,
which by their
nature are all related.*

**The object that is cosmos surely is an object that we will at some point be able to hold in our minds.

*Those who are able to see beyond the
shadows and lies of their culture will
never be understood,
let alone believed, by the masses.*

**It's weird that the lies are usually believed by the masses rather than the few. I suppose both cases happen simultaneously.

*Those who have a natural talent
for calculation are generally
quick-witted at every other kind of
knowledge; and even the dull,
if they have had an arithmetical training,
although they may derive
no other advantage from it, always
become much quicker than
they would have been.*

**Practicing math spills over to other cognitive aspects of your life.

*Those who tell the stories rule society.*

**Who tells the stories interestingly shifts from time to time. Journalists, politicians, marketers, individuals, etc.

*To the rulers of the state then,
if to any, it belongs of right to use
falsehood, to deceive either enemies
or their own citizens, for the good of the
state: and no one else may
meddle with this privilege.*

**Why should they have that right? How does that benefit the people?

*We ought to esteem it of the
greatest importance that the fictions
which children first hear should be
adapted in the most perfect
manner to the promotion of virtue.*

**The stories that we grow up on has great impact on our morals and what we think it is to be a good person. This will however start changing as you grow older and embark on a path that's closer to the way things really are.

*True friendship can
exist only between equals.*

**I've experienced both sides of this. What is it about the inequality that prevents friendship? It undermines the very definition of what it means to be friends.

*We are like people
looking for something
they have in their hands all the time;
we're looking in all directions except at
the thing we want,
which is probably
why we haven't found it.*

**The more intensely we look the more frustrated we become and the blinder we are to the fact that it's in our own hands.

*Wealth, and poverty;
the one is the parent
of luxury and indolence,
and the other of meanness and
viciousness, and both of discontent.*

**What's in-between?

*We shall be better and braver and less
helpless if we think that we ought to
enquire, than we should have been if we
indulged in the idle fancy that there was
no knowing and no use in seeking to
know what we do not know;—
that is a theme upon which
I am ready to fight,
in word and deed,
to the utmost of my power.*

**Being either complacent or nihilistic towards knowledge is dangerous.

*When men speak ill of thee, live so that
nobody will believe them.*

**This is the way that people who are uncancellable operate.

*What kind of man am I?
One of those who would be pleased
to be refuted if I say anything untrue,
and who would be pleased to refute
anyone who says anything untrue;
one who, however, wouldn’t be any less
pleased to be refuted than to refute.
For I count being refuted a greater
good, insofar as it is a greater good
for oneself to be delivered
from the worst thing
there is than to deliver
someone else from it.*

**I wish more people thought like this and that more people liked being disagreeable.

*When the tyrant has disposed of foreign
enemies by conquest or treaty,
and there is nothing to fear from them,
then he is always stirring up some war
or other, in order that
the people may require a leader.*

**When has war been good for the people? I suppose there are some wars that have been fought for human rights and for true liberty. But the war had to be fought in the first place due to others being evil.

*Wisdom alone is the true and unalloyed
coin for which we ought to
exchange all things,
for this and with this
everything is bought and sold
Fortitude, temperance, and justice; in a
word, true virtue subsists with wisdom.*

**Wisdom seeking is the path to virtue.

*Without any one teaching him he will
recover his knowledge for himself,
if he is only asked questions*

**Does asking yourself questions count? What questions should I be asked but won't occur to me personally?

*When we become more fully aware
that our success is due in large
measure to the loyalty, helpfulness,
and encouragement we have received
from others, our desire grows
to pass on similar gifts.
Gratitude spurs us on to prove
ourselves worthy of what others have
done for us. The spirit of gratitude is a
powerful energizer.*

**It's so easy to forget this. But when we remind ourselves how things really are, what beauty we've been exposed to, it really is energizing.
