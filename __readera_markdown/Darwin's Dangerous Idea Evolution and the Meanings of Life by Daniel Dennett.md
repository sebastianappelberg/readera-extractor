*So, if Locke is right, Mind must come first — or at least tied for first. It could not come into existence at some later date, as an effect of some confluence of more modest, mindless phenomena. This purports to be an entirely secular, logical — one might almost say mathematical — vindication of a central aspect of Judeo-Christian (and also Islamic) cosmogony: in the beginning was something with Mind — "a cogitative Being," as Locke says. The traditional idea that God is a rational, thinking agent, a Designer and Builder of the world, is here given the highest stamp of scientific approval: like a mathematical theorem, its denial is supposedly impossible to conceive.*

**I wonder what Dennett would say about the resurgence of idealism, which is proposed by people like Donald Hoffman.

*Look round the world. Contemplate the whole and every part of it: You will find it to be nothing but one great machine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and explain. All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles, exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance — of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble, and that the Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man, though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work which he has executed. By this argument a posteriori, and by this argument alone, do we prove at once the existence of a Deity and his similarity to human mind and intelligence.*

**People who believe in intelligent design are often very good observers of the beauty and marvel of the seeming perfection in nature. They are however blind to the messy parts.

*Cute ideas about evolution had been floating around for millennia, but, like most philosophical ideas, although they did seem to offer a solution of sorts to the problem at hand, they didn't promise to go any farther, to open up new investigations or generate surprising predictions that could be tested, or explain any facts they weren't expressly designed to explain. The evolution revolution had to wait until Charles Darwin saw how to weave an evolutionary hypothesis into an explanatory fabric composed of literally thousands of hard-won and often surprising facts about nature. Darwin neither invented the wonderful idea out of whole cloth all by himself, nor understood it in its entirety even when he had formulated it. But he did such a monumental job of clarifying the idea, and tying it down so it would never again float away, that he deserves the credit if anyone does.*

**Structure and clarity is sometimes what you need in order to start building a monumental artifact of truth. You need a strong foundation to build on. You may have intuitions and you may have some wild ideas, but if there's no place for them to take root there won't be anything solid.

*Suppose ... that matter were thrown into any position, by a blind, unguided force; it is evident that this first position must in all probability be the most confused and most disorderly imaginable, without any resemblance to those works of human contrivance, which, along with a symmetry of parts, discover an adjustment of means to ends and a tendency to self-preservation... Suppose, that the actuating force, whatever it be, still continues in matter... Thus the universe goes on for many ages in a continued succession of chaos and disorder. But is it not possible that it may settle at last... ? May we not hope for such a position, or rather be assured of it, from the eternal revolutions of unguided matter, and may not this account for all the appearing wisdom and contrivance which is in the universe?*

**I think the "throwing pieces of metal and hoping it will get structured" argument is very misleading. It doesn't take into account the massive scale of tries that happens at a microscopic level. If we didn't have that speed it'd would have taken perhaps an unfeasible amount of time to build up complexity. Speed and feedback are key.

*Problems in science are sometimes made easier by adding complications. The development of the science of geology and the discovery of fossils of manifestly extinct species gave the taxonomists further curiosities to confound them, but these curiosities were also the very pieces of the puzzle that enabled Darwin, working alongside hundreds of other scientists, to discover the key to its solution: species were not eternal and immutable; they had evolved over time. Unlike carbon atoms, which, for all one knew, had been around forever in exactly the form they now exhibited, species had births in time, could change over time, and could give birth to new species in turn. This idea itself was not new; many versions of it had been seriously discussed, going back to the ancient Greeks. But there was a powerful Platonic bias against it: essences were unchanging, and a thing couldn't change its essence, and new essences couldn't be born — except of course by God's command in episodes of Special Creation. Reptiles could no more turn into birds than copper could turn into gold.*

**Essentialism may be true for math but for living things, it is not. For anything that evolves, it's not. What do we do when we can't carve nature at its joints? Can we still talk about essences but recognize that they may change? What about individuals rather than species?

*"More individuals are born than can possibly survive. A grain in the balance will determine which individual shall live and which shall die, — which variety or species shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally become extinct"*

**What role does the difficulty of the environment play? What if the environment is extremely easy? There's food enough forever, there's space for all, etc. Does diversity get unhinged then, like in the Cambrian explosion? 

---
Page: 58

*The further diversification into species would occur, Darwin argued, because if there was a variety of heritable skills or equipment in a population (of a single species), these different skills or equipment would tend to have different payoffs for different subgroups of the population, and hence these subpopulations would tend to diverge, each one pursuing its favored sort of excellence, until eventually there would be a complete parting of the ways. Why, Darwin asked himself, would this divergence lead to separation or clumping of the variations instead of remaining a more or less continuous fan-out of slight differences? Simple geographical isolation was part of his answer; when a population got split by a major geological or climatic event, or by haphazard emigration to an isolated range such as an island, this discontinuity in the environment ought to become mirrored eventually in a discontinuity in the useful variations observable in the two populations. And once discontinuity got a foothold, it would be self-reinforcing, all the way to separation into distinct species. Another, rather different, idea of his was that in intraspecific infighting, a "winner take all" principle would tend to operate*

**Discontinuity in the environment is key for variation. You wouldn't want to run your algorithm in the same environment. The algorithm is the same, the environment is different. 

**How do you know you're still dealing with an intermediary variation? I suppose that until you reach an equilibrium, that's what you should expect. To me an equilibrium is the same as reaching what's optimal given all conditions. If the conditions change the equilibrium may need to change. 

**What's the expected speed of speciation and reaching equilibrium? How many generations does it take? Should be a mathematical constant.

*But if variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus characterized will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterized. This principle of preservation, I have called, for the sake of brevity, Natural Selection.*

**How was the capacity for inheritance evolved? What are the prerequisites for evolution to start working?

Page: 68

*underlying mindlessness: Although the overall design of the procedure may be brilliant, or yield brilliant results, each constituent step, as well as the transition between steps, is utterly simple. How simple? Simple enough for a dutiful idiot to perform — or for a straightforward mechanical device to perform.*

**The algorithm itself has to be evolvable or at least afforded through pure physics and mechanics of the universe. It's most likely several smaller components that make it up. What are those smaller components and how can they interact in the first place?

---
Page: 71

*But the algorithms that will concern us have nothing particular to do with the number system or other mathematical objects; they are algorithms for sorting, winnowing, and building things.*

**Ping for sorting, I hadn't thought of that before. What's winnowing? It's the filtering. So sorting, filtering and building. I guess each play a huge orthogonal role.

---
Page: 71

*people sometimes make the elementary mistake of thinking that a process that makes use of chance or randomness is not an algorithm*

**Another ingredient, randomness.

Page: 75

*Skill and luck intermingle naturally and inevitably in any real competition, but their ratios may vary widely. A tennis tournament played on very bumpy courts would raise the luck ratio, as would an innovation in which the players were required to play Russian roulette with a loaded revolver before continuing after the first set. But even in such a luck-ridden contest, more of the better players would tend, statistically, to get to the late rounds. The power of a tournament to "discriminate" skill differences in the long run may be diminished by haphazard catastrophe, but it is not in general reduced to zero. This fact, which is as true of evolutionary algorithms in nature as of elimination tournaments in sports, is sometimes overlooked by commentators on evolution.*

**Another ingredient: luck. Though that's the same thing as randomness but it may be useful to name it specifically. 

**Another ingredient: skill. The skill will necessarily be context dependent. The question is, what's the game being played in the first place? How do you define it? How do you devise a tournament for finding the most skillful players? 

---
Page: 76

*Thus there has to be some measure of uniformity of the conditions of competition for there to be any interesting outcome to a tournament.*

**An ingredient to the competition: a measure of uniformity. How is nature uniform? Food, energy, consistent environment?

*Just as there is an algorithm (many, actually) for finding the square root of any number, so there are algorithms for finding the square root of any number except 18 or 703. Some algorithms do things so boringly irregular and pointless that there is no succinct way of saying what they are for. They just do what they do, and they do it every time.*

**The search space of algorithms is huge. Is nature only relying on a few? If so, how did it find those particular ones? Or is it messier? How does it even search for algorithms? Does the laws of nature just make sure it happens all the time? 

---
Page: 77

*Evolution can be an algorithm, and evolution can have produced us by an algorithmic process, without its being true that evolution is an algorithm for producing us. The main conclusion of Stephen Jay Gould's Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History (1989a) is that if we were to "wind the tape of life back" and play it again and again, the likelihood is infinitesimal of Us being the product on any other run through the evolutionary mill. This is undoubtedly true (if by "Us" we mean the particular variety of Homo sapiens we are: hairless and upright, with five fingers on each of two hands, speaking English and French and playing tennis and chess). Evolution is not a process that was designed to produce us, but it does not follow from this that evolution is not an algorithmic process that has in fact produced us.*

**What about convergent evolution? Some ideas are so universal that they pop up in one way, shape or form. 

---
Page: 77

*These are typically investigations into what an evolutionary algorithm might produce, or could produce, or is likely to produce, and only indirectly into what such an algorithm would inevitably produce.*

**What would one call this? The domain of the algorithm? The output of a particular set of algorithms applied over time isn't known even though the output of each instance of applying each algorithm is known.

Page: 79

*So powerful is this optimization procedure that it has been used as the inspiration for an entirely general problem-solving technique in computer science — "simulated annealing," which has nothing to do with metals or heat, but is just a way of getting a computer program to build, disassemble, and rebuild a data structure (such as another program), over and over, blindly groping towards a better — indeed, an optimal — version (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi 1983). This was one of the major insights leading to the development of "Boltzmann machines" and "Hopfield nets" and the other constraint-satisfaction schemes that are the basis for the Connectionist or "neural-net" architectures in Artificial Intelligence.*

**This would be very to try out for compression. What's the theoretical limit to compression through annealing? Would it even work? How do you jumble the pieces up and put them together and know that you can reconstruct the original? 

---
Page: 85

*The fact that it has the branching organization of a tree is crucial to the explanation of the sort of process involved, for such  {62}  a tree could be created by an automatic, recursive process: first build an x, then modify x's descendants, then modify those modifications, then modify the modifications of the modifications — If Life is a Tree, it could all have arisen from an inexorable, automatic rebuilding process in which designs would accumulate over time.*

**I wonder how many candidates for the seed of the tree there were. Perhaps there were some smaller trees before it? It kind of feels like the coinflip tournament.

---
Page: 88

*If redesign could be a mindless, algorithmic process of evolution, why couldn't that whole process itself be the product of evolution, and so forth, all the way down?*

**Is it in fact necessary that it goes all the way down? Can you simulate evolution without simulating the universe?

*It is not unusual to find such metaphors, redolent of capitalism, in evolutionary explanations. Examples are often gleefully recounted by those critics and interpreters of Darwin who see this language as revealing — or should we say betraying — the social and political environment in which Darwin developed his ideas, thereby (somehow) discrediting their claim to scientific objectivity. It is certainly true that Darwin, being an ordinary mortal, was the inheritor of a huge manifold of concepts, modes of expression, attitudes, biases, and visions that went with his station in life (as a Victorian Englishman might put it), but it is also true that the economic metaphors that come so naturally to mind when one is thinking about evolution get their power from one of the deepest features of Darwin's discovery.*

**We're all embedded in an environment of false assumptions, and we can't make clean transitions from those to new assumptions. That's why we need new generations that don't have our baggage.

*Hume recognized the point — "Throw several pieces of steel together, without shape or form; they will never arrange themselves to compose a watch" — but he and other, earlier, thinkers thought they had to ground this deep fact in Mind. Darwin came to see how to distribute it in vast spaces of Nonmind, thanks to his ideas about how design innovations could be conserved and reproduced, and hence accumulated.*

**What are the prerequisites for accumulation of design? There has to be a level of compatibility between the variations. There has to be a clear transport mechanism for the accumulations. What else?

---
Page: 100

*What I am calling the Principle of Accumulation of Design doesn't logically require that all design (on this planet) descend via one branch or another from a single trunk (or root or seed), but it says that since each new designed thing that appears must have a large design investment in its etiology somewhere, the cheapest hypothesis will always be that the design is largely copied from earlier designs, which are copied from earlier designs, and so forth, so that actual R-and-D innovation is minimized. We know for a fact, of course, that many designs have been independently re-invented many times — eyes, for instance, dozens of times — but every case of such convergent evolution must be proven against a background in which most of the design is copied. It is logically possible that all the life forms in South America were created independently of all the life forms in the rest of the world, but this is a wildly extravagant hypothesis that would need to be demonstrated, piece by piece. Suppose we discover, on some remote island, a novel species of bird.*

**Economical/logistical principles seem to play a big role in evolution. 

---
Page: 105

*Let us understand that a skyhook is a "mind-first" force or power or process, an exception to the principle that all design, and apparent design, is ultimately the result of mindless, motiveless mechanicity. A crane, in contrast, is a subprocess or special feature of a design process that can be demonstrated to permit the local speeding up of the basic, slow process of natural selection, and that can be demonstrated to be itself the predictable (or retrospectively explicable) product of the basic process.*

**Perhaps it'd be a bad idea to do evolutionary programs based on the most primitive version of natural selection, perhaps one should find as many cranes as possible and leap frog it? What are the most indispensable cranes for speeding up evolution? Sex, genetic engineering, the Baldwin effect. What else helps us effectively traverse the interesting parts of the design space?

Page: 113

*We must distinguish reductionism, which is in general a good  {82}  thing, from greedy reductionism, which is not. The difference, in the context of Darwin's theory, is simple: greedy reductionists think that everything can be explained without cranes; good reductionists think that everything can be explained without skyhooks.*

**To be fair I think some people who propose reductionism do propose greedy reductionism.  

---
Page: 113

*There is no reason to be compromising about what I call good reductionism. It is simply the commitment to non-question-begging science without any cheating by embracing mysteries or miracles at the outset.*

**Dennett was extremely consistent about this and that's what made his thinking interesting.

*the eukaryotes were certainly an improvement, since, thanks to their internal complexity, they could specialize, and this eventually made possible the creation of multicelled organisms, such as ourselves.*

**The capacity for specialization and division of labor is a key factor to building complexity. What are the prerequisites for it? One is certainly that their needs are met through trade. Although that's not necessarily true in bodies. Our heart cells don't demand anything from our liver cells. Well other than them both contributing to a livable environment. There's no direct trade route between them but there's an indirect one.

*One thing can be sure: whatever region we color in will be a single, connected region. No separated blobs of organisms, no matter how similar in appearance or morphology, could count as composed of members of a single species, which must be united by descent.*

**What about plant and fungi fusions? What about bacteria and animal fusions? Do we still hold them as distinct? A species could be made up of several other species then. 

---
Page: 132

*This sort of inquiry is familiar to philosophers. It is the Socratic activity of definition-mongering or essence-hunting: looking for the "necessary and sufficient conditions" for being-an-X. Sometimes almost everyone can see the pointlessness of the quest — islands obviously don't have real essences, but only nominal essences at best. But at other times there can still seem to be a serious scientific question that needs answering.*

**Why are we so horny for classifications? The other extreme is to think of everything being of the same essence, only having nominal essences that differentiate us.

---
Page: 140

*The same moral applies to the creation of new genera, families, and even kingdoms, of course. The major branching that we would retrospectively crown as the parting of the plants from the animals began as a segregation of two gene pools every bit as inscrutable and unremarkable at the time as any other temporary drifting apart of members of a single population.*

**The fact that speciation can only be witnessed retroactively and that it is in fact open for change by events in the future makes it tricky to understand. 

---
Page: 143

*I think the case is strong that not only do "over"-simplified models often actually explain just what needs explaining, but no more complicated model could do the job. When what provokes our curiosity are the large patterns in phenomena, we need an explanation at the right level. In many instances this is obvious. If you want to know why traffic jams tend to happen at a certain hour every day, you will still be baffled after you have painstakingly reconstructed the steering, braking, and accelerating processes of the thousands of drivers whose various trajectories have summed to create those traffic jams.*

**How do you know what level of detail gives you the most explanatory leverage? 

---
Page: 147

*There seem to be at least four different kinds or grades of possibility: logical, physical, biological, and historical, nested in that order.*

**Possibilities change over time. Especially when you anchor them in real situations. It's physically possible for me to clap my hands together, but if I lose an arm that is no longer the case.

*Imagine traveling by spaceship through the Moby Dick galaxy of the Library of Babel. This galaxy is in itself Vastly larger than the whole physical universe, so, no matter what direction you go in, for centuries on end, even if you travel at the speed of light, all you see are virtually indistinguishable copies of Moby Dick — you will never ever reach anything that looks like anything else. David Copperfield is unimaginably distant in this space, even though we know that there is a path — a shortest path, ignoring the kazillions of others — leading from one great book to the other by single typographical changes. (If you found yourself on this path, you would find it almost impossible to tell, by local inspection, which direction to go to move towards David Copperfield, even if you had texts of both target books in hand.)*

**What if you made sure to index every location by the whole content of the book? Then as long as you have the correct book at hand, you'd be able to know its location instantly. Getting there is another issue.

*One of the important features of DNA is that all the permutations of sequences of Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine are about equally stable, chemically. All could be constructed, in principle, in the  {113}  gene-splicing laboratory, and, once constructed, would have an indefinite shelf life, like a book in a library. But not every such sequence in the Library of Mendel corresponds to a viable organism. Most DNA sequences — the Vast majority — are surely gibberish, recipes for nothing living at all. That is what Dawkins means, of course, when he says there are many more ways of being dead (or not alive) than ways of being alive. But what kind of a fact is this, and why should it be so?*

**The punchline is crisp. The possibilities are vast but the viable options, or even just near viable, is just a small slice of the possibilities.

---
Page: 160

*This is what makes the story of Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park (1990) — and the Steven Spielberg movie made of it — a fantasy: even completely intact dinosaur DNA would be powerless to re-create a dinosaur without the aid of a dinosaur-DNA-reader, and those are just as extinct as dinosaurs (they are, after all, the ovaries of dinosaurs). If you have a (living) dinosaur ovary, then it, together with dinosaur DNA, can specify another dinosaur, another dinosaur ovary, and so forth indefinitely, but dinosaur DNA by itself, even complete dinosaur DNA, is only half (or, depending on how you count, maybe less than half) the equation. We might say that every species that has ever existed on this planet has had its own dialect of DNA-reading. Still, these dialects have had a lot in common with each other. The principles of DNA-reading are apparently uniform across all species, after all. That is what makes genetic engineering possible; the organismic effect of a particular permutation in DNA can often be predicted in practice. So the idea of bootstrapping our way back to a dinosaur-DNA-reader is a coherent idea, however improbable. With a helping of poetic license, the film-makers might pretend that acceptable substitute readers could be found (introduce the dinosaur-DNA text to the DNA-reader in a frog, and hope for the best).*

**It's easy to get hung up on DNA as being all that matters, but let's not forget that we need hardware to execute software. How in the hell did they evolve together? What came first? What did the in-between states look like? There can be hardware whose program is defined by the structure of the hardware rather than needing software. Start there and then start building up the necessary building blocks for software. 

**What would happen if you feed human DNA to a frog embryo?

*A tiger is viable now, in certain existing environments on our planet, but would not have been viable in most earlier days, and may become inviable in the future (as may all life on Earth, in fact). Viability is relative to the environment in which the organism must make its living. Without breathable atmosphere and edible prey — to take the most obvious conditions — the organic features that make tigers viable today would be to no avail. And since environments are to a great extent composed of, and by,  {116}  the other organisms extant, viability is a constantly changing property, a moving target, not a fixed condition.*

**The environment is the filter for organisms once they're successfully born. And the environment changes all the time. 

---
Page: 163

*But it does mean that there may be fundamental differences between the space of genomes and the space of "possible" organisms. The fact that we can consistently describe a finished product — say, a giraffe with green stripes instead of brown blotches — does not guarantee that there is a DNA recipe for making it. It may just be that, because of the peculiar requirements of development, there simply is no starting point in DNA that has such a giraffe as its destination.*

**What causes this discrepancy? What's the role of epigenetics and bioelectrics in this?

---
Page: 172

*The imperious restrictions we encounter inside the Library of Mendel may look like universal laws of nature from our myopic perspective, but from a different perspective they may appear to count as merely local conditions, with historical explanations.13 If so, then a restricted concept of biological possibility is the sort we want; the ideal of a universal concept of biological possibility will be misguided. But as I have already allowed, this does not rule out biological laws; it merely sets the burden of proof for those who want to propose any. And in the meantime, it gives us a framework for describing large and important classes of regularity we discover in the patterns in our biosphere.*

**We're able to think of different trajectories in terms of probability. Having said that I think that we're unable to know very far out what's likely, and we can't even see all possibilities until we get close enough. 

**We're able to reason about the way that steps are taken in the design space. 

**We're able to clearly explain the historic trajectory of what is. There are no magic leaps or spontaneous life popping up. 

---
Page: 176

*We don't need laws of biology to "prevent" most of the physical possibilities from becoming actualities; sheer absence of opportunity will account for most of them. The only "reason" all your nonactual aunts and uncles never came into existence is that your grandparents didn't have time or energy (to say nothing of the inclination) to create more than a few of the nearby genomes. Among the many nonactual possibles, some are — or were — "more possible" than others: that is, their appearance was more probable than the appearance of others, simply because they were neighbors of actual genomes, only a few choices away in the random zipping-up process that puts together the new DNA volume from the parent drafts, or only one or a few random typos away in the great copying process. Why didn't the near-misses happen? No reason; they just didn't happen to happen. And then, as the actual genomes that did happen to happen began to move away from the locations in Design Space of the near-misses, their probability of ever happening grew smaller. They were so close to becoming actual, and then their moment passed! Will they get another chance? It is possible, but Vastly improbable, given the Vast size of the space in which they reside.*

**Time, energy and chance are the greatest filters in a vast design space. 

**When a random walk starts drifting from a particular place it gets less and less probable for it to visit the same place as it came from. 

---
Page: 178

*Is Design something that can be measured, even indirectly and imperfectly? Curiously enough, skepticism about this prospect actually undercuts the most potent source of skepticism about Darwinism. As I pointed out in chapter 3, the most powerful challenges to Darwinism have always taken this form: are Darwinian mechanisms powerful enough, or efficient enough, to have done all that work in the time available? All what work? If the question concerned mere sideways drifting in the typographical space of possible genomes, the answer would be obvious and uncontroversial: Yes, there has been much more than enough time. The speed at which random drift should accumulate mere typographical distance can be calculated, giving us a sort of posted speed limit, and both theory and observation agree that actual evolution happens much slower than that.1 The "products" that are impressive to the skeptics are not the diverse DNA strings in themselves, but the amazingly intricate, complex, and well-designed organisms whose genomes those strings are.*

**Just pruning by time, energy and randomness cannot create and accumulate anything interesting over time. There has to be a filter on top that steers things into a particular direction. I suppose fitness is that filter. Or is it in fact way more multidimensional? 

---
Page: 181

*So at least some "biological necessities" may be recast as obvious solutions to most general problems, as forced moves in Design Space. These are cases in which, for one reason or another, there is only one way things can be done. But reasons can be deep or shallow. The deep reasons are the constraints of the laws of physics — such as the Second Law of Thermodynamics, or the laws of mathematics or logic.2 The shallow reasons are just historical. There used to be two or more ways this problem might be solved, but now that some ancient historical accident has set us off down one particular path, only one way is remotely available; it has become a "virtual necessity," a necessity for all practical purposes, given the cards that have been dealt. The other options are no longer really options at all.*

**How are the obvious solutions tested? I suppose that's where survival and fitness comes in. If the solution is inefficient for physics reasons it will be outcompeted by more efficient solutions. How does life deal with local optima? Can you end up in a dead end, and does that necessarily mean extinction? 

**Can these forced moves be witnessed in innovation and technology as well? Does intelligent design help us make better jumps in design space or is it in fact misleading?

*Consider the set of all possible processes, which Minsky interprets a la the Library of Babel as all permutations of all possible computers. (Any computer can be identified, abstractly, as one "Turing machine" or another, and these can be given unique identifying numbers, and then put in numerical order, just like the alphabetical order in the Library of Babel.) Except for a Vanishing few, the Vast majority of these processes "do scarcely anything at all." So if you find "two" that do something similar (and worth noticing), they are almost bound to be one and the same process, at some level of analysis. Minsky (p. 122) applies the principle to arithmetic:
From all this, I conclude that any entity who searches through the simplest processes will soon find fragments which do not merely resemble arithmetic but are arithmetic. It is not a matter of inventiveness or imagination, only a fact about the geography of the universe of computation, a world far more constrained than that of real things.*

**If you start from a "truth" the search for the simplest process that generates it you have a quick way of verifying and discarding. If you have a vision of the future that can act as a very efficient filter in a design space.

*Some lineages get trapped in (or are lucky enough to wander into — take your pick) a path in Design Space in which complexity begets complexity, in an arms race of competitive design. Others are fortunate enough (or unfortunate enough-take your pick) to have hit upon a relatively simple solution to life's problems at the outset and, having nailed it a billion years ago, have had nothing much to do in the way of design work ever since. We human beings,  {135}  complicated creatures that we are, tend to appreciate complexity, but that may well be just an aesthetic preference that goes with our sort of lineage; other lineages may be as happy as clams with their ration of simplicity.*

**Technical innovation has this on steroids. The more complicated and powerful the technology the more severe its externalities tends to be. Innovation creates problems that begets more innovation. It's interesting to hear that sometimes species are fine the way things are and stay the same, will we and our technology reach such a place? Is that even possible for us at this point?

*Intuitively, the difference is the difference between discovery and creation, but we now have a better way of seeing it. On the one hand, there is design work that homes in on a best move or forced move which can be seen (in retrospect, at least) to be a uniquely favored location in Design Space accessible from many starting points by many different paths; on the other hand, there is design work the excellence of which is much more dependent on exploiting (and amplifying) the many contingencies of history that shape its trajectory, a trajectory about which the bus company's slogan is an understatement: getting there is much more than half the fun.*

**Both are discoveries in design space but they are very different in kind. I like this explication of discovery versus creation.

*Science, unlike the arts, is engaged in journeys — sometimes races — with definite destinations: solutions to specific problems in Design Space. But scientists do care just as much as artists do about the routes taken, and hence would be appalled at the idea of discarding Newton's actual work and just saving his destination (which someone else would eventually have led us to in any case). They care about the actual trajectories because the methods used in them can often be used again, for other journeys; the good  {141}  methods are cranes, which can be borrowed, with acknowledgment, and used to do lifting in other parts of Design Space. In the extreme case, the crane developed by a scientist may be of much more value than the particular lifting accomplished by it, the destination reached. For instance, a proof of a trivial result may nevertheless pioneer a new mathematical method of great value. Mathematicians put a high value on coming up with a simpler, more elegant proof of something they have already proved — a more efficient crane.*

**Are there cranes for finding better cranes? The history of paradigm shifts in technology has been driven by finding new cranes. How will AI allow us to explore design spaces?

*Darwin explains a world of final causes and teleological laws with a principle that is, to be sure, mechanistic but — more fundamentally — utterly independent of "meaning" or "purpose". It assumes a world that is absurd in the existentialist's sense of the term: not ludicrous but pointless, and this assumption is a necessary condition of any non-question-begging account of purpose.*

**If we successfully create artificial consciousness, what will it take as its goal and purpose? Would it be a meaningful question to it?

*Wondrous to say, there is a candidate with just the right properties, and more wondrous still, it is just what the Bible ordered: clay! Cairns-Smith shows that in addition to the carbon-based self-replicating crystals of DNA and RNA, there are also much simpler (he calls them "low-tech") silicon-based self-replicating crystals, and these silicates, as they are called, could themselves be the product of an evolutionary process.*

**Cycles of motion and shapeable materia. Through repetition and a little bit of noise you set the stage for incremental building.

*In his elegant little book, Steps Towards Life (1992) — a good place to continue your exploration of these ideas — he shows how the macros gradually built up what he calls the "molecular toolkit" that living cells use to recreate themselves, while also building around themselves the sorts of structures that became, in due course, the protective membranes of the first prokaryotic cells.*

**I wonder if there is any value in trying to simulate prebiotic evolution in order to get at complexity.

*(In the million-dimension Library of Mendel, sequences that differ at a single locus are shelved "next to" each other in some dimension; the distance of any one volume from another is technically known as the Hamming distance. This process spreads "winners" out gradually — taking leaps of small Hamming distances — from any initial starting point in any and all directions in the Library.) This is the most rudimentary possible case of "the rich get richer," and since the success of the string has an explanation with no reference beyond the string itself and its resemblance as a string to its parent string, this is a purely syntactic definition of fitness, as opposed to a semantic definition of fitness (Kiippers 1990, p. 141). That is, you don't have to consider what the string means in order to determine its fitness.*

**It's in the very basics of complexity theory where you'll find the dynamics of early life. 

**How many letter differences would've actually made a difference? How many are completely equivalent in terms of structural stability?

*These very first "semantic" links are of course so utterly simple and local that they hardly count as semantic at all, but we can see a glimmer of reference in them nevertheless: there is a fortuitous wedding of a bit of nucleotide string with a protein fragment that helped directly or indirectly to reproduce it. The loop is closed; and once this "semantic" assignment system is in place, everything speeds up. Now a fragment of code-string can be the code for something — a protein. This creates a new dimension of evaluation, because some proteins are better than others at doing catalytic work, and particularly at assisting in the replication process.*

*As more and more has been learned about the development of the universe since the Big Bang, about the conditions that permitted the formation of galaxies and stars and the heavy elements from which planets can be formed, physicists and cosmologists have been more and more struck by the exquisite sensitivity of the laws of nature. The speed of light is approximately 186,000 miles per second. What if it were only 185,000 miles per second, or 187,000 miles per second? Would that change much of anything? What if the force of gravity were 1 percent more or less than it is? The fundamental constants of physics — the speed of light, the constant of  {165}  gravitational attraction, the weak and strong forces of subatomic interaction, Planck's constant — have values that of course permit the actual development of the universe as we know it to have happened. But it turns out that if in imagination we change any of these values by just the tiniest amount, we thereby posit a universe in which none of this could have happened, and indeed in which apparently nothing life-like could ever have emerged:*

**Do they ever consider changing a set of laws instead of just one at the time? How many configurations are there that are balanced and support a cosmos with life?

Page: 229

*Darwin deduces that human beings must have evolved from a common ancestor of the chimpanzee, or that all life must have arisen from a single beginning, and some people, unaccountably, take these deductions as claims that human beings are somehow a necessary product of evolution, or that life is a necessary feature of our planet, but nothing of the kind follows from Darwin's deductions properly construed. What must be the case is not that we are here, but that since we are here, we evolved from primates. Suppose John is a bachelor. Then he must be single, right? (That's a truth of logic.) Poor John — he can never get married! The fallacy is obvious in this example, and it is worth keeping it in the back of your mind as a template to compare other arguments with.*

**I'll dub it the Must Fallacy until I find its official name.

Page: 234

*Or, in the terms I have developed in earlier writings (1971, 1978, 1987b), when we adopt the physical stance towards a configuration in the Life world, our powers of prediction are perfect: there is no noise, no uncertainty, no probability less than one. Moreover, it follows from the two-dimensionality of the Life world that nothing is hidden from view. There is no backstage; there are no hidden variables; the unfolding of the physics of objects in the Life world is directly and completely visible.*

**If you make the 2D space large enough you may run into computational infeasibilities, even though everything is perfectly predictable. You cannot predict whether a stable configuration, like a still lifer, will be stable indefinitely. You may get a projectile that's launched from outside of your computational reach.

*What does this machine look like? Poundstone calculates that the whole construction would be on the order of 1013 cells or pads.  {173} 
Displaying a 1013-pixel pattern would require a video screen about 3 million pixels across at least. Assume the pixels are 1 millimeter square (which is very high resolution by the standards of home computers). Then the screen would have to be 3 kilometers (about two miles) across. It would have an area about six times that of Monaco.*

**You could easily emulate pixels instead and let the landscape be out of view so to speak. You'd not be able to get a view of the whole thing, unless there'd be a way to compress the patterns when you zoom out while not changing the internal behavior in any way.

*In other words, by the time you have built up enough pieces into something that can reproduce itself (in a two-dimensional world), it is roughly as much larger than its smallest bits as an organism is larger than its atoms. You probably can't do it with anything much less complicated, though this has not been strictly proven. The hunch with which we began this chapter gets dramatic support: it takes a lot of design work (the work done by Conway and his students) to turn available bits and pieces into a self-replicating thing; self-replicators don't just fall together in cosmic coincidences; they are too large and expensive.*

**Perhaps that is a very suitable way of measuring the needed complexity? What is the size difference between a bacteria and its atoms? How many molecules and proteins is it made of?

*In evolutionary theory, the new discipline of Artificial Life has recently sprung up to provide a name and an umbrella to cover a veritable Gold Rush of researchers at different levels, from the submolecular to the ecological.*

**When studying artificial life forms it's probably as interesting, if not more so, to study their relationship to each other and other life forms. The dynamics and the relationships, not just component properties.

*I spoke with Conway once about the creation of the Game of Life, and he lamented the fact that explorations of the Life world were now almost exclusively by "empirical" methods — setting up all the variations of interest on a computer and letting her rip to see what happens. Not only did this usually shield one from even the opportunity of devising a strict proof of what one found, but, he noted, people using computer simulations are typically insufficiently patient; they try out combinations and watch them for fifteen or twenty minutes, and if nothing of interest has happened, they abandon them, marking them as avenues already explored and found barren. This myopic style of exploration risks closing off important avenues of research prematurely. It is an occupational hazard of all computer simulators, and it is simply their high-tech version of the philosopher's fundamental foible: mistaking a failure of imagination for an insight into necessity. A prosthetically enhanced imagination is still liable to failure, especially if it is not used with sufficient rigor.*

**This is one of the things that worries me the most about AI. We need rigor, we need discipline, we need passion, we need courage to go beyond. How could we synthesize those aspects into our automated exploration of all design spaces? Is exploration of design spaces the right way to think about it? Somehow it leaves open the dynamics of the space and more importantly completely novel ways of conceptualizing creativity.

Page: 242

*When Conway and his students first set out to create a two-dimensional world in which interesting things would happen, they found that nothing seemed to work. It took more than a year for this industrious and ingenious group of intelligent searchers to find the simple Life Physics rule in the Vast space of possible simple rules. All the obvious variations turned out to be hopeless. To get some sense of this, try altering the "constants" for birth and death — change the birth rule from three to four, for instance — and see what happens. The worlds these variations govern either freeze up solid in no time or evaporate into nothingness in no time. Conway and his students wanted a world in which growth was possible, but not too explosive; in which "things" — higher-order patterns of cells — could move, and change, but also retain their identity over time. And of course it had to be a world in which structures could "do things" of interest (like eat or make tracks or repel things). Of all the imaginable two-dimensional worlds, so far as Conway knows, there is only one that meets these desiderata: the Life world. In any event, the variations that have been checked in subsequent years have never come close to measuring up to Conway's in terms of interest, simplicity, fecundity, elegance. The Life world might indeed be the best of all possible (two-dimensional) worlds.*

**What should be considered an interesting world? Are there worlds that are even more dynamic than our own? What if we wrote rules for an n-dimensional world? Will the necessary rules change in some predictable way? 

---
Page: 247

*Several versions of this speculation have been seriously considered by physicists and cosmologists in recent years. John Archibald Wheeler (1974), for instance, has proposed that the universe oscillates back and forth for eternity, a Big Bang is followed by expansion, which is followed by contraction into a Big Crunch, which is followed by another Big Bang, and so fordi forever, with random variations in the constants and other crucial parameters occurring in each oscillation. Each possible setting is tried an infinity of times, and so every variation on every theme, both those that "make sense" and those that are absurd, spins itself out, not once but an infinity of times.*

**What if this happened in the blink of an eye from some cosmic perspective? Just like it feels for us when watching a computer crunch trillions of possible worlds in a matter of seconds? What could the computational power of the cosmic materia be?

Page: 249

*Darwin began his attack on the Cosmic Pyramid in the middle: Give me Order, and time, and I will explain Design. We have now seen how the downward path of universal acid flows: if we give his successors Chaos (in the old-fashioned sense of pure meaningless randomness), and eternity, they will explain Order — the very Order needed to account for the Design. Does utter Chaos in turn need an explanation? What is there left to explain? Some people think there is still one leftover "why" question: Why is there something rather than nothing? Opinions differ on whether the question makes any intelligible demand at all.10 If it does, the answer "Because God  {181}  exists" is probably as good an answer as any, but look at its competition: "Why not?"*

**Chaos, order, physics, design, agency. Does the cosmic pyramid go deeper still? What comes after agency?

*The moral seems clear: if the meaning of this drama must come from on high, from a Creator, it would be an obscene joke, a trivialization of the strivings of the individuals in that world. But what if the meaning is somehow the creation of the individuals themselves, arising anew in each incarnation rather than as a gift from on high? This might open up the possibility of meaning that was not threatened by repetition.
This is the defining theme of existentialism in its various species: the only meaning there can be is the meaning you (somehow) create for yourself. How that trick might be accomplished has always been something of a mystery among existentialists, but as we shall soon see, Darwinism does have some demystification to offer in its account of the process of meaning-creation. The key, once again, is the abandonment of John Locke's Mind-first vision, and its replacement with a vision in which importance itself, like everything else that we treasure, gradually evolves from nothingness.*

**If life came from nothing, why couldn't all of our abstract concepts also come from nothing? It's the creation and discovery dichotomy. Some of it may really be out there as our numbers are, some if it isn't. Which one is meaning? A little bit of both? There ought to be idea configurations that are more structurally stable than others and those are probably the ones that stay with us.

*What does need its origin explained is the concrete universe itself, and as Hume's Philo long ago asked: Why not stop at the material world? It, we have seen, does perform a version of the ultimate bootstrapping trick; it creates itself ex nihilo, or at any rate out of something that is well-nigh indistinguishable from nothing at all. Unlike the puzzlingly mysterious, timeless self-creation of God, this self-creation is a non-miraculous stunt that has left lots of traces. And, being not just concrete but the product of an exquisitely particular historical process, it is a creation of utter uniqueness — encompassing and dwarfing all the novels and paintings and symphonies of all the artists — occupying a position in the hyperspace of possibilities that differs from all others.*

**Nothingness is the virgin mother of cosmos.

*I have never even heard anybody in the field described as a philosopher of engineering — as if there couldn't possibly be enough conceptual material of interest in engineering for a philosopher to specialize in. But this is changing, as more and more philosophers come to recognize that engineering harbors some of the deepest, most beautiful, most important thinking ever done.*

**The complexity theorist seem to have adopted engineering more than most fields.

*And as he hypothesized with regard to organisms, "competition will generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly related to each other"*

**Ping! Competition isolation or competitive range. I'm not sure what to call it but it's yet another important ingredient in evolution.

*In response to these challenges, Darwin's idea has grown stronger. Today we can see that not only Aristotle's divisions but also other cherished compartmentalizations of science are threatened by its territorial expansion. The Germans divide learning into Naturwissenschaften, the natural sciences, and Geistesiwissenschaften, the sciences of mind, meaning, and culture, but this sharp divide — cousin to C. P. Snow's Two Cultures (1963) — is threatened by the prospect that an engineering perspective will spread from biology up through the human sciences and arts. If there is just one Design Space, after all, in which the offspring of both our bodies and our minds are united under one commodious set of R-and-D processes, then these traditional walls may tumble.*

**The unification or at least harmonization of polarities is something that the world is crying out for. Currently we're splitting ourselves in half and each half is trying to get rid of the other one.

*It doesn't really matter to my main thesis whether Darwin himself even existed! He could be, like the Average Taxpayer, a sort of mythical Virtual Author, for all I care. (Some authorities place Homer in that category.) The actual historical man does fascinate me; his curiosity, integrity, and stamina inspire me; his personal fears and flaws make him lovable. But he is, in a way, beside the point. He had the good fortune to be the midwife for an idea that has a life of its own, precisely because it does grow and change. Most ideas can't do that.*

**Some ideas are more fruitful than entire lineages of humans.

*His research is a sequence of biological construction problems posed and solved: how do the materials get amassed at the building site, and how does the design get determined, and in what order are the various parts assembled so that they don't fall apart before the whole structure is completed?*

**I would love to know more about how biological creatures grow. How is an apple formed? How is the bark on a tree formed? How does it not fall apart? What are the building blocks? What is the process of forming the building blocks and putting them together?

*Functionally competent mutants, whose selection values come close to that of the wild type (though remaining below it), reach far higher population numbers than those that are functionally ineffective. An asymmetric spectrum of mutants builds up, in which mutants far removed from the wild type arise successively from intermediates. The population in such a chain of mutants is influenced decisively by the structure of the value landscape. The value landscape consists of connected plains, hills, and mountain ranges. In the mountain ranges, the mutant spectrum is widely scattered, and along ridges even distant relatives of the wild type appear with finite [that is, not infinitesimal] frequency. It is precisely in the mountainous regions that further selectively superior mutants can be expected. As soon as one of these turns up on the periphery of a mutation spectrum the established ensemble collapses. A new ensemble builds up around the superior mutant, which thus takes over the role of the wild type... This causal chain results in a kind of 'mass action', by which the superior mutants are tested with much higher probability than inferior mutants, even if the latter are an equal distance away from the wild type.*

**You need to explore neighboring hills in order to not get stuck in local optimum. A population with variants that are functional but not mainstream. Don't ever settle, keep exploring. Be quick to move when the landscape changes beneath your feet. Never step down, step up whenever possible.

*"The seemingly irreducible, or excess, information is contained in the specific conditions of the protein's environment, and only together with these can the genetic information determine unambiguously the structure and thus the function of the protein molecule."*

**The reader of information always adds to it by their interpretation. The interpretation is expressed differently depending on the type of code and type of reader. A runtime reading machine code does its thing. A DNA reader does its thing. The final result is not determined by the code in isolation. 

---
Page: 273

*We see here a special case of a very general principle: any functioning structure carries implicit information about the environment in which its function "works." The wings of a seagull magnificently embody principles of aerodynamic design, and thereby also imply that the creature whose wings these are is excellently adapted for flight in a medium having the specific density and viscosity of the atmosphere within a thousand meters or so of the surface of the Earth. Recall the example in chapter 5 of sending the score of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony to "Martians." Suppose we carefully preserved the body of a seagull and sent it off into space (without any accompanying explanation), to be discovered by these Martians. If they  {198}  made the fundamental assumption that the wings were functional, and that their function was flight (which might not be as obvious to them as we, who have seen them do it, think), they could use this assumption to 'read off' the implicit information about an environment for which these wings would be well designed. Suppose they then asked themselves how all this aerodynamic theory came to be implicit in the structure, or, in other words: How did all this information get into these wings? The answer must be: By an interaction between the environment and the seagull's ancestors.*

**Designs carry implicit information about the environment they were formed in. Different kinds of designs carry different kinds of implicit information. You should be able to infer a lot from the architecture and structure of a system. The level of skill of its creators, the time pressure they've been under, the stage the company is in, the power balance in the company, etc.

*But even in the case of such a QWERTY phenomenon, if the conditions are just right and the opportunities and hence pressures are great enough, the tables might be turned and a new standard established. This is apparently just what happened when the DNA language displaced the RNA language as the lingua franca of encoding for complex organisms. The reasons for its preferability are clear: by being double-stranded, the DNA language permitted a system of error-correcting or proofreading enzymes, which could repair copying errors in one strand by reference to its mate. This made the creation of longer, more complicated genomes feasible*

**Error correction was powerful enough of a feature that DNA could replace the incumbent RNA. Evolution always discovers reasons by retroactive endorsement.

*We know as a matter of logic that there was at least one start that has us as its continuation, but there were probably many false starts that differed in no interesting way at all from the one that initiated the winning series. The title of Adam is, once again, a retrospective honor, and we make a fundamental mistake of reasoning if we ask, In virtue of what essential difference is this the beginning of life? There need be no difference at all between Adam and Badam, an atom-for-atom duplicate of Adam who just happened not to have founded anything of note.*

**How should we intuit gradualism, historical contingency, forced moves and just general meandering in design space where the steps are almost so small that they look continuous?

Page: 283

*Darwin turned this doctrine upside down: intentionality doesn't come from on high; it percolates up from below, from the initially mindless and pointless algorithmic processes that gradually acquire meaning and intelligence as they develop. And, perfectly following the pattern of all Darwinian thinking, we see that the first meaning is not full-fledged meaning; it certainly fails to manifest all the "essential" properties of real meaning (whatever you may take those properties to be). It is mere quasi-meaning, or semi-semantics. It is what John Searle (1980,1985,1992) has disparaged as mere "as if intentionality" as opposed to what he calls "Original Intentionality." But you have to start somewhere, and the fact that the first step in the right direction is just barely discernible as a step towards meaning at all is just what we should expect.*

**Meaning can be gradually built from mindless matter.

Page: 280

*Right from the beginning, the cost of doing something is running the risk of doing it wrong, of making a mistake. Our slogan could be: No taking without mistaking. The first error that ever was made was a typographical error, a copying mistake that then became the opportunity for creating a new task environment (or fitness landscape) with a new criterion of right and wrong, better and worse. A copying error "counts" as an error here only because there is a cost to getting it wrong: termination of the reproductive line at worst, or a diminution in the capacity to replicate. These are all objective matters, differences that are there whether or not we look at them, or care about them, but they bring in their train a new perspective. Before that moment, no opportunity for error existed. However things went, they went neither right nor wrong. Before that moment, there was no stable, predictive way of exercising the option of adopting the perspective from which errors might be discerned, and every mistake anybody or anything has ever made since is dependent on that original error-making process. In fact, there is strong selection pressure for making the genetic copying process as high-fidelity as possible, minimizing the likelihood of error. Fortunately, it cannot quite achieve perfection, for if it did, evolution would grind to a halt.*

**The source of evolution is the possibility of errors happening. Without errors there can be no creativity, nothing new. That's not quite true since the possibility for errors to happen had to be created from simpler parts. What are the prerequisites for fruitful errors to happen? In replication and in general.

Page: 283

*There are two paths to intentionality. The Darwinian path is diachronic, or historical, and concerns the gradual accretion, over billions of years, of the sorts of Design — of functionality and purposiveness — that can support an intentional interpretation of the activities of organisms (the "doings" of "agents"). Before intentionality can be fully fledged, it must go through its awkward, ugly period of featherless pseudo-intentionality. The synchronic  {206}  path is the path of Artificial Intelligence, in an organism with genuine intentionality — such as yourself — there are, right now, many parts, and some of these parts exhibit a sort of semi-intentionality, or mere as if intentionality, or pseudo-intentionality — call it what you like — and your own genuine, fully fledged intentionality is in fact the product (with no further miracle ingredients) of the activities of all the semi-minded and mindless bits that make you up (this is the central thesis defended in Dennett 1987b, 1991a). That is what a mind is — not a miracle-machine, but a huge, semi-designed, self-redesigning amalgam of smaller machines, each with its own design history, each playing its own role in the "economy of the soul." (Plato was right, as usual, when he saw a deep analogy between a republic and a person — but of course he had much too simple a vision of what this might mean.)*

**What are all of our smaller machines? How do they interact? What's their impact on the emergent whole? What laws of dynamics do they operate under? How do you change your own functionality? How do you upgrade the relationship between your small machines?

Page: 285

*Can it be that if you put enough of these dumb homunculi together you make a real conscious person? The Darwinian says there could be no other way of making one. Now, it certainly does not follow from the fact that you are descended from robots that you are a robot. After all, you are also a direct descendant of some fish, and you are not a fish; you are a direct descendant of some bacteria, and you are not a bacterium. But unless dualism or vitalism is true (in which case you have some extra, secret ingredient in you), you are made of robots — or what comes to the same thing, a collection of trillions of macromolecular machines. And all of these are ultimately descended from the original macros. So something made of robots can exhibit genuine consciousness, or genuine intentionality, because you do if anything does.*

**The robots are in turn made of particles. The laws of physics and the matter that exists in the universe can come together to construct things like molecules and DNA which are small machines. In a sense as soon as you have two different things and you can organize them however you like, you can represent an infinity of things and ideas. 

**What are more abstract notions composed of? What is friendship? What is justice? Those abstract things are more like code than actual structures. They need to be read, interpreted and enacted. They are no less real for that matter. Their code is not in the form of text. It's sitting in our interactions, our artifacts, our ideas/brains.

*Heuristic search is one of the foundational ideas of Artificial Intelligence. One might even define the task of the field of AI as the creation and  {210}  investigation of heuristic algorithms. But there is also a tradition within computer science and mathematics of contrasting heuristic methods with algorithmic methods: heuristic methods are risky, not guaranteed to yield results, whereas algorithms come with a guarantee. How do we resolve this "contradiction"? There is no contradiction at all. Heuristic algorithms are, like all algorithms, mechanical procedures that are guaranteed to do what they do, but what they do is engage in risky search! They are not guaranteed to find anything — or at least they are not guaranteed to find the specific thing sought in the amount of time available.*

**Guaranteed search versus risky search. I like that distinction, that makes it clear that they're both doing the same thing but in different ways.

Page: 289

*Instead of trying to find the search procedure himself, Samuel tried to get the computer to find it. He wanted the computer to design its own evaluation function, a mathematical formula — a polynomial — that would yield a number, positive or negative, for every move it considered, such that, in general, the higher the number, the better the move. The polynomial was to be concocted of lots of pieces, each contributing positively or negatively, multiplied by one coefficient or another, and adjusted to various other circumstances, but Samuel had no idea what sort of concoction would work well. He made some thirty-eight different chunks — "terms" — and threw them into a "pool." Some of the terms were intuitively valuable, such as those giving points for increased mobility or potential captures, but others were more or less off the wall — such as "DYKE: the parameter is credited with  {211}  1 for each string of passive pieces that occupy three adjacent diagonal squares."*

**Are polynomials the best thing to use? Life's components seem to be way more jiggly and in tune with the environment they're in. 

---
Page: 290

*By a lot of inspired guesswork and even more inspired tuning and tinkering, Samuel devised rules for elimination from the tournament, and found ways of keeping the brew stirred up, so that the trial-and-error process was likely to hit upon good combinations of terms and coefficients and recognize them when it did.*

**One of the trickiest parts to get right, outside of clearly defined games, is the evaluation step. How do you judge whether a trial was a success or not? You need feedback from the environment. And sometimes it's not about success so much as just interestingness.

*Of course, if the wisdom of the reverse engineers includes a healthy helping of self-knowledge, they will recognize that this default assumption of optimality is too strong: sometimes engineers put stupid, pointless things in their designs, sometimes they forget to remove things that no longer have  {213}  a function, sometimes they overlook retrospectively obvious shortcuts. Still, optimality must be the default assumption; if the reverse engineers can't assume that there is a good rationale for the features they observe, they can't even begin their analysis.*

**I'd say let economics drive the effort put into understanding whether it had a good design rationale or not. What I mean is, look at components and design decisions that contribute the most to the performance or other attribute that you're interested in. 

---
Page: 294

*As we have already seen, even at the molecular level you just can't do biology without doing reverse engineering, and you can't do reverse engineering without asking what reasons there are for whatever it is you are studying. You have to ask "why" questions. Darwin didn't show us that we don't have to ask them; he showed us how to answer them*

**Whenever you have a knee-jerk reaction to something just because it doesn't feel like it fits into "the way" we know do things, stop and ask yourself whether it's warranted or not.

*Human engineers typically attempt to insulate subsystems from each other, and insist on an overall design in which each subsystem has a single, well-defined function within the whole.
The set of supersystems having this fundamental abstract architecture is  {216}  vast and interesting, of course, but it does not include very many of the systems designed by natural selection! The process of evolution is notoriously lacking in foresight. Since it has no foresight at all, unforeseen or unforeseeable side effects are nothing to it; it proceeds, unlike human engineers, via the profligate process of creating vast numbers of relatively uninsulated designs, most of which are hopelessly flawed because of self-defeating side effects, but a few of which, by dumb luck, are spared that ignominious fate. Moreover, this apparently inefficient design philosophy carries a tremendous bonus that is relatively unavailable to the more efficient, top-down process of human engineers: thanks to its having no bias against unexamined side effects, it can take advantage of the rare cases where beneficial serendipitous side effects emerge. Sometimes, that is, designs emerge in which systems interact to produce more than was aimed at. In particular (but not exclusively), one gets elements in such systems that have multiple functions.*

**How do we make systems made up of subsystems that are not insulated from each other? How do we create systems bottom up? How do we create environments where it's possible to do that? Could we loosely constrain our systems so that they're free in how they navigate the design space but the space itself excludes undesired outcomes?

*When you ask functional questions about anything — organism or artifact — you must remember that it has to come into its current or final form by a process that has its own requirements, and these are exactly as amenable to functional analysis as any features of the end state. No bell rings to mark the end of building and the beginning of functioning (cf. Fodor 1987, p. 103). The requirement that an organism be a going concern at every stage of its life places iron constraints on its later features.*

**The process by which something comes into existence sets constraints and sometimes leaves traces. Looking at finished products is not enough to understand it fully, you need to understand the production process. The functional aspect is dependent on the developmental aspect.

*Now that it is possible to build truly complex evolutionary scenarios on computers, rewinding the tape over and over, we can see patterns that eluded earlier Darwinian theorists. What we see, Kauffman claims, is that order "shines through" in spite of selection, not because of it. Instead of witnessing the gradual accrual of organization under the steady pressure of cumulative selection, we witness the inability of selective pressure (which can be carefully manipulated and monitored in the simulations) to overcome an inherent tendency of the populations in question to resolve themselves into ordered patterns. So this seems at first to be a striking demonstration that natural selection cannot be the source of organization and order after all — which would indeed be the downfall of the Darwinian idea.
But there is another way of looking at it, as we have seen. What conditions have to be in effect for evolution by natural selection to occur? The words 1 put into Darwin's mouth were simple: Give me Order, and time, and I will give you Design. But what we have subsequently learned is that not every variety of Order is sufficient for evolvability. As we saw illustrated by Conway's Game of Life, you have to have just the right sort of Order, with just the right mix of freedom and constraint, growth and decay, rigidity and fluidity, for good things to happen at all. You only get evolution, as the Santa Fe motto proclaims, on the edge of chaos, in the regions of possible law that  {222}  form the hybrid zone between stifling order and destructive chaos.*

**What does it mean to sit at the edge of chaos? How does one fine-tune an evolutionary algorithm? How did it happen in the universe?

*evolvability itself not only must evolve (for us to be here), but is likely to evolve, is almost sure to evolve, because it is a forced move in the game of Design.20 Either you find the path that leads to evolvability or you don't go anywhere, but finding the path to evolvability is not such a big deal; it's "obvious." The principles of design that make biological evolution possible will be found, again and again and again, no matter how many times we rerun the tape. "Contrary to all our expectations, the answer, I think, is that it may be surprisingly easy"*

**What is the simplest possible starting point?

Page: 306

*But what about features of the process of creating those products? If there are fundamental rules about how things have to be designed, about the order in which design innovations can be created, the strategies of design that are bound to work or fail, then these should be homed in on by evolution just as surely as the features of the finished products. What Kauffman has discovered, I submit, is not so much laws of form as rules for designing: the imperatives of meta-engineering. Kauffman has many telling observations to make about just such principles of meta-engineering that govern the process by which new designs could, in practice, be created. We can consider them to be features of the whole phenomenon of evolution that have already been discovered, have already gone to fixation, in effect, in our part of the universe. (We will not be surprised to find them everywhere else in the universe where there are designed things, because this is the only way to design things.)*

**How far are we in terms of meta-engineering? Perhaps its time to start looking at Stuart's work.

*Adaptive evolution is a search process — driven by mutation, recombination, and selection — on fixed or deforming fitness landscapes. An adapting population flows over the landscape under these forces. The structure of  {223}  such landscapes, smooth or rugged, governs both the evolvability of populations and the sustained fitness of their members. The structure of fitness landscapes inevitably imposes limitations on adaptive search. [Kauffman 1993, p. 118.]
Notice that this is all pure Darwinism — every bit acceptable and nonrevolutionary, but with a major shift of emphasis to the role of the topology of the fitness landscape, which, Kauffman argues, has a profound effect on the rate at which design innovations can be found, and the order in which design chances can accumulate*

**How does one simulate fitness landscapes? It's more of an emergent phenomenon than a thing.

*When I was a boy I felt that the role of rhyme in poetry was to compel one to find the unobvious because of the necessity of finding a word which rhymes. This forces novel associations and almost guarantees deviations from routine chains or trains of thought. It becomes paradoxically a sort of automatic mechanism of originality.*

**Constraints not only prune design spaces, they put pressure on the search so that it finds more beautiful artifacts and paths to them.

*Until you manage to evolve communicating organisms that can form large engineering organizations, you are bound by the following Preliminary Design Principle: all global order must be generated by local rules. So all the early products of design, up to the creation of something with some of the organizational talents of Homo sapiens, must obey whatever constraints follow from the "management decision" that all order must be accomplished by local rules. Any "attempts" to create living forms that violate this precept will end in immediate failure — or, more accurately, will not even get started sufficiently to be discernible as attempts.*

**How does one extend the game of life to produce something that could in principle be interesting? How "free" and uncontrolled does the process need to be to generate interesting things? Is AI something you could evolve on a computer?

*You are less apt to have a disastrous crash than if you try to come up with a new way of preparing the foundation. So it is not so surprising that churches all start out looking more or less alike, with the big differences emerging in the later elaborations of the building process. Actually, says Kauffman, there really just aren't as many different possible solutions to the foundation problem as there are to later building problems. Even stupid contractors who butted their heads against this fact for eons would not come up with a wide variety of foundation designs.*

**When does the foundation stop and the later development start?

*Does anyone suppose that there are laws of nutrition? Laws of locomotion? There are all sorts of highly imperturbable boundary conditions on nutrition and locomotion, owing to fundamental laws of physics, and there are plenty of regularities, rules of thumb, trade-offs, and the like that are encountered by any nutritional or locomotive mechanisms. But these are not laws. They are like the highly robust regularities of automotive engineering. Consider the regularity that (ceteris paribus) ignition is accomplished only by or after the use of a key. There is a reason for this, of course, and it has to do with the perceived value of automobiles, their susceptibility to theft, the cost-effective (but not foolproof) options provided by preexisting locksmith technology, and so forth. When one understands the myriad cost-benefit trade-offs of the design decisions that go into creating automobiles, one appreciates this regularity. It is not any kind of law; it is a regularity that tends to settle out of a complex set of competing desiderata (otherwise known as norms).*

**Regularities seems to be a more open concept than laws. It's probably much more suited for fuzzy things.

*They treat the artifact under examination as a product of a process of reasoned design development, a series of choices among alternatives, in which the decisions reached were those deemed best by the designers. Thinking about the postulated functions of the parts is making assumptions about the reasons for their presence, and this often permits one to make giant leaps of inference that finesse one's ignorance of the underlying physics, or the lower-level design elements of the object.*

**What is it that permits these giant leaps? Is it because it works like a constraint on the process for creating the artifact? We kind of simulate the creator in our head and as such we see more clearly what options they had before themselves. The physical stance, the design stance, the intentional stance. The hyperobject stance, where you can reason effectively by assuming certain properties in complex adaptive systems.

*Since mice are a species in which females tend to mate with more than one male, males in effect compete to exploit the resources of each female, a competition from which females must protect themselves (and their own genetic contributions).*

**It's like genes try to the best they can with the machine they happened to get. Are there other competitive strategies at play that happens below the level of mate selection?

*Adopting the intentional stance towards the configuration, you could predict its future as a chess-player performing intentional actions — making chess moves and trying to achieve checkmate. First you would have to figure out the interpretation scheme that permits you to say which configurations of pixels count as which symbols: which glider pattern spells out "QxBch" (Queen takes Bishop; check) and the other symbols for chess moves. But then you could use the interpretation scheme to predict, for instance, that the next configuration to emerge from the galaxy would be such-and-such a glider stream — say, the symbols for "RxQ" (Rook takes Queen). There is risk involved, because the chess program being run on the Turing machine may be far from perfectly rational, and, at a different level, debris may wander onto the scene and "break" the Turing-machine configuration before it finishes the game. But if all goes well, as it normally will, if you have the right interpretation, you can astonish your friends by saying something like "I predict that the next stream of gliders to emerge in location L in this Life galaxy will have the following pattern: a singleton, followed by a group of three, followed by another singleton ..." How on Earth were you able to predict that that particular "molecular" pattern would appear then?2*

**How does the stability of the structures and behaviors change as you go up and down the stack? It's quite right that the chess algorithm is not perfect, but it'd be weird to say that the particles would be moving imperfectly.

---
Page: 326

*Consider the savings you could achieve. At first you would be confronted by a screen on which trillions of pixels flash on and off. Since you know the single rule of Life Physics, you could laboriously calculate the behavior of each spot on the screen if you wanted, but it would take eons. As a first cost-cutting step, you could shift from thinking about individual pixels to thinking about gliders and eaters and still lifes, and so forth. Whenever you  {236}  saw a glider approaching an eater, you would just predict "consumption in four generations" without bothering with the pixel-level calculations. As a second step, you could move to thinking of the gliders as symbols on the "tape" of a gigantic Turing machine, and then, adopting this higher design stance towards the configuration, predict its future as a Turing machine. At this level you would be "hand-simulating" the "machine language" of a computer program that plays chess, still a tedious way of making predictions, but orders of magnitude more efficient than working out the physics. As a third and still more efficient step, you could ignore the details of the chess-playing program itself and just assume that, whatever they are, they are good! That is, you could assume that the chess-playing program running on the Turing machine made of gliders and eaters played not just legal chess but good legal chess — it had been well designed (perhaps it has designed itself, in the manner of Samuel's checkers program) to find the good moves. This permits you to shift to thinking about chessboard positions, possible chess moves, and the grounds for evaluating them — to shift to reasoning about reasons.*

**It would be interesting to know the efficiency gains for every level of description. How does one transition between the levels? When does a new level form? There ought to be some limit depending on the material and the environment. 

---
Page: 328

*We can put the burden of proof on the skeptics with a simple challenge argument: if there weren't design in the biosphere, how come the intentional stance works? We can even get a rough measure of the design in the biosphere by comparing the cost of making predictions from the lowest-level physical stance (which assumes no design — well, almost no design, depending on how we treat the evolution of universes) with the cost of making predictions from the higher stances: the design stance and the intentional stance. The added leverage of prediction, the diminution of uncertainty, the shrinkage of the huge search space to a few optimal or  {238}  near-optimal paths, is a measure of the design that is observable in the world.*

**Let's not limit ourselves to the intentional stance. For hyperobjects we'll get something similar. Right now it doesn't make sense to say X is happening because it makes the economy happier. We need a higher level stance for hyperobjects. A hyperobject doesn't need to be at the scale of an economy, it could just be a large company or system, not necessarily physically large but large in number of components, relations and dynamics.

*Leibniz, notoriously, said that this was the best of all possible worlds, a striking suggestion that might seem preposterous from a distance, but turns out, as we have seen, to throw an interesting light on the deep questions of  {239}  what it is to be a possible world, and on what we can infer about the actual world from the fact of its actuality.*

**An actuality among possibilities gives you lots of information to work with. Why out of all possibilities is this the one that was instantiated?

*But you will already have noticed that in each case these rules of thumb can be overridden by a more ambitious inquiry. Suppose someone marveling at the brilliant autumn foliage in New England asks why the maple leaves are so vividly colored in October. Isn't this adaptationism run amok? Shades of Dr. Pangloss! The leaves are the colors they are simply because once the summer energy-harvest season is over, the chlorophyll vanishes from the leaves, and the residual molecules have reflective properties that happen to determine the bright colors — an explanation at the level of chemistry or physics, not biological purpose. But wait. Although this may have been the only explanation that was true up until now, today it is true that human beings so prize the autumn foliage (it brings millions of tourist dollars to northern New England each year) that they protect the trees that are brightest in autumn. You can be sure that if you are a tree competing for life in New England, there is now a selective advantage to having bright autumn foliage. It may be tiny, and in the long run it may never amount to much (in the long run, there may be no trees at all in New England, for one reason or another), but this is how all adaptations get their start, after all, as fortuitous effects that get opportunistically picked up by selective forces in the environment. And of course there is also an adaptationist explanation for why right angles predominate in manufactured goods, and why symmetry predominates in organic limb-manufacturing. These may become utterly fixed traditions, which would be almost impossible to dislodge by innovation, but the reasons why these are the traditions are not hard to find, or controversial.*

**Whatever is able to get you to the truth should be used, no matter what your aesthetic preferences are. Adaptationism seems to be a very fruitful lense to look through, so why not do that and if you're in disbelief use other lenses to corroborate the story.

*Von Neumann created game theory in collaboration with the economist Oskar Morgenstern, and it grew out of their realization that agents make a fundamental difference to the complexity of the world.14 Whereas a lone "Robinson Crusoe" agent can view all problems as seeking stable maxima — hill-climbing on Mount Fuji, if you like — as soon as other (maxima-seeking) agents are included in the environment, strikingly different methods of analysis are required*

*An ESS is a strategy that does well against copies of itself. The rationale for this is as follows. A successful strategy is one that dominates the population. Therefore it will tend to encounter copies of itself. Therefore it won't stay successful unless it does well against copies of itself. This definition is not so mathematically precise as Maynard Smith's, and it cannot replace his definition because it is actually incomplete. But it does have the virtue of encapsulating, intuitively, the basic ESS idea.*

**This feels like the source of institutional decay. For systems not to ossify I think you need occasional massive perturbations from the outside.

*This is not, in many regards, welcome news. Von Neumann's all-too-casual remark on the inevitability of human selfishness epitomizes the Darwinian mindset that many people view with loathing, and it is not hard to see why. They fear that Darwinian "survival of the fittest" would entail that people are nasty and selfish. Isn't that just what von Neumann is saying? No. Not quite. He is saying that it is indeed entailed by Darwinism that such virtues as cooperation should be in general "evolutionarily unenforceable" and hence hard to come by. If cooperation and the other unselfish virtues are to exist, they must be designed — they do not come for free. They can be designed under special circumstances. (See, for instance, Eshel 1984, 1985, and Haig and Grafen 1991) After all, the eukaryotic revolution that made multicelled organisms possible was a revolution that began when an enforceable truce was somehow engineered between certain prokaryotic cells and their bacterial invaders. They found a way of joining forces and submerging their selfish interests.*

**What traps are we facing and how do we design our way out of them? Should be possible to apply in smaller settings and then iteratively expand.

*But our dismissal of actualism should not tempt us to err in the other direction, supposing that the space of real possibilities is much more densely populated than it actually is. The temptation, when we think about phenotypic variation, is to adopt a sort of Identikit tactic of assuming that all the minor variations we can imagine on the themes we find in actuality are truly available. Carried to extremes, this tactic will always vastly — Vastly — overestimate what is actually possible. If the actual Tree of Life occupies vanishingly narrow threads through the Library of Mendel, the actually possible Tree of Life is itself some rather bushier but still far from dense partial filling of the apparently possible. We have already seen that the Vast space of all imaginable phenotypes — Identikit Space, we might call it — no doubt includes huge regions for which there are no recipes in the Library of Mendel. But even along the paths through which the Tree of Life wanders, we are not guaranteed that the neighboring regions of Identikit Space are actually all accessible.*

**Hidden constraints makes the job of reverse engineering harder. At the same time reverse engineering is probably the best way to uncover those hidden constraints.

*I realized then that the largely imaginary Queen Elizabeth II of these young children (what philosophers would call their intentional object) was in some regards a more potent and interesting object in the world than the actual woman. Intentional objects are the creatures of beliefs, and hence they play a more direct role in guiding (or misguiding) people's behavior than do the real objects they purport to be identical to. The gold in Fort Knox, for example, is less important than what is believed about it, and the Albert Einstein of myth is, like Santa Claus, much better known than the relatively dimly remembered historical fellow who was the primary source for the myth.*

**What is the dynamics of beliefs? How much does it take to change them? In what ways can it be done? How are they formed? How do they guide our behaviors?

*What the actual design of the San Marco spandrels — that is, pendentives — has going for it are mainly two things. First, it is (approximately) the "minimal-energy" surface (what you would get if you stretched a soap film in a wire model of the corner), and hence it is close to the minimal surface area (and hence might well be viewed as the optimal solution if, say, the number of costly mosaic tiles was to be minimized!). Second, this smooth surface is ideal for the mounting of mosaic images — and that is why the  {274}  Basilica of San Marco was built: to provide a showcase for mosaic images. The conclusion is inescapable: the spandrels of San Marco aren't spandrels even in Gould's extended sense. They are adaptations, chosen from a set of equipossible alternatives for largely aesthetic reasons. They were designed to have the shape they have precisely in order to provide suitable surfaces for the display of Christian iconography.*

**You don't need to destroy paradigms if you can adapt them. In this case the attempt at discrediting adaptionism seem to have only strengthened it. 

**I like the notion of aesthetic adaptation, it speaks to Deutsch's notion that there's objective beauty. 

---
Page: 387

*But, according to orthodox Darwinism, every adaptation is one sort of exaptation or the other — this is trivial, since no function is eternal; if you go back far enough, you will find that every adaptation has developed out of predecessor structures each of which either had some other use or no use at all. The only phenomena that Gould's exaptation revolution would rule out are the phenomena that orthodox adaptationists "quickly" disavowed in any case: planned-for preadaptations.*

**Exaptation is serendipity. It's a quirk of design space, some spaces appear in multiple places, some spaces have their shape reformed over time.

*It is hard to be a revolutionary if the establishment keeps co-opting you. Gould has often complained that his target, neo-Darwinism, recognizes the very exceptions he wants to turn into objections, "and this imposes a great frustration upon anyone who would characterize the modern synthesis in order to criticize it"*

**Darwinism seems to be antifragile. Bitcoin is similar that way.

*As Dawkins has noted, the way in which Eldredge and Gould challenged "gradualism" was not, in the end, by positing some exciting new nongradualism, but by saying that evolution, when it occurred, was indeed gradual — but most of the time it was not even gradual; it was at a dead stop. The lefthand diagram in figure 10.6 is supposed to represent orthodoxy, but the feature of it that their theory challenged was not its gradualism — once we get the scale right, they are gradualists themselves. The feature they were challenging was what Dawkins (1986a, p. 244) calls "constant speedism."*

**Equilibrium tells me that to keep exploring you need to constantly shift the environment so that you get as many punctuations as possible. Although it also tells me that you have to wait for quite a while before equilibrium is achieved. The problem is that evolution doesn't have a gradient mechanism towards something "better" so using it to find something better will be tricky. The best that you can do is let a thousand flowers bloom and hope that there are some that are to your liking.

*Many species once formed never undergo any further change ...; and the periods, during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form. [Origin, 4th and subsequent eds; see Peckham 1959, p. 727.]*

**I suppose some species get backed into a corner in design space and have a hard time backtracking. In those cases a too sudden shift in selection pressure probably means extinction. 

---
Page: 404

*Nevertheless, the phenomenon of stasis might be a real one in need of explanation. We should ask not why species exhibit stability (something true by definition) but why there are salient, identifiable species — that is, why lineages go stable at all. But even here, neo-Darwinism has several obvious adaptationist explanations for why stasis should often occur in a lineage. We have already seen the primary one several times: every species is — must be — a going concern, and going concerns must be conservative; most deviations from the time-tested tradition will be quickly punished by extinction. Eldredge himself (1989) has suggested that a major reason for stasis is "habitat tracking." Sterelny (1992, p. 45) describes it this way:
As the environment changes, organisms may react by tracking their old habitat. They might move north as the climate cools, rather than by evolving adaptations to the cold. [This is not a mistake — Sterelny is a Southern Hemisphere philosopher of biology!] Selection will usually drive tracking. For migrants that follow the habitat (personally or by reproductive dispersion) will typically be fitter than the population fragment that fails to move, for the residual fragment will be less well adapted to the new environment and will be faced with new competition from other migrants tracking their old habitat.*

**Let's not forget that life is agential, it can in some sense affect what selection pressures it's put under. Not to say that it can predict how it'll evolve because of them. Habitat tracking as a concept makes things more complex. 

**Sudden jumps in design space almost always leads to extinction, so in life we don't see it but what about an artificial intelligence? I suppose that the design space is too vast to hope for anything good to come out of random jumps. Having that said, if you have a well defined jumping off point you could perhaps target your jumps?

*Rapidity of change is crucially affected by the size of the gene pool; large gene pools are conservative and tend to absorb innovation attempts without a trace. One way of making a large gene pool small is dividing it in two, and this may in fact be the most common sort of downsizing*

**What about really small gene pools, are they too unstable for anything interesting to happen? Either way it's good to know that the size of the gene pool matters for the speed of change. 

---
Page: 402

*Dawkins dramatizes the point by passing along an eye-opening thought experiment by the evolutionist G. Ledyard Stebbins, who imagines a mouse-sized mammal for which he postulates such a tiny selection pressure in favor of increased size that there would be no increase in size measurable by biologists studying the animal:
As far as the scientist studying evolution on the ground is concerned, then, these animals are not evolving at all. Nevertheless they are evolving, very slowly at a rate given by Stebbins' mathematical assumption, and even at this slow rate, they would eventually reach the size of elephants. How long would this take?... Stebbins calculates that at his assumed very slow rate of evolution, it would take about 12,000 generations.... Assuming a generation time of five years, which is longer than that of a mouse but shorter than that of an elephant, 12,000 generations would occupy about 60,000 years. 60,000 years is too short to be measured by ordinary geological methods of dating the fossil record. As Stebbins says, The origin of a new kind of animal in 100,000 years or less is regarded by paleontologists as "sudden" or "instantaneous".*

**You can play around with numbers to see how fast you can expect to see certain features forming. Gradual change in feature, rate of evolution and generation time.

*This idea is what Gould and Eldredge (1993, p. 224) call "higher level sorting." It is sometimes known as species selection, or clade selection. It is hard to get clear about, but we have the equipment already at hand to clarify its central point. Remember bait-and-switch? Gould is in effect proposing a new application of this fundamental Darwinian idea: don't think that evolution makes adjustments in existing lineages; evolution throws away whole lineages, and lets other, different, lineages prosper. It looks as if there are adjustments to lineages over time, but what is really going on is bait-and-switch at the species level. The right level at which to look for evolutionary trends, he could then claim, is not the level of the gene, or the organism, but the whole species or clade. Instead of looking at the loss of particular genes from gene pools, or the differential death of particular genotypes within a  {298}  population, look at the differential extinction rate of whole species and the differential "birth" rate of species — the rate at which a lineage can speciate into daughter species.*

**Something can be selected by virtue of being what's left after having removed everything else. What does speciation fecundity mean for AI algorithms?

*There aren't global pathways of progress, but there is incessant local improvement. This improvement seeks out the best designs with such great reliability that it can often be predicted by adaptationist reasoning. Replay the tape a thousand times, and the Good Tricks will be found again and again, by one lineage or another. Convergent evolution is not evidence of global progress, but it is overwhelmingly good evidence of the power of processes of natural selection. This is the power of the underlying algorithms, mindless all the way down, but, thanks to the cranes it has built along the way, wonderfully capable of discovery, recognition, and wise decision. There is no room, and no need, for skyhooks.*

*Gould is ready to draw a fairly specific religious conclusion from his own consideration of the implications of paleontology:
We are the offspring of history, and must establish our own paths in this most diverse and interesting of conceivable universes — one indifferent to our suffering, and therefore offering us maximal freedom to thrive, or to fail, in our own chosen way.*

*In our world today, there are organisms we know to be the result of foresighted, goal-seeking redesign efforts, but that knowledge depends on our direct knowledge of recent historical events; we've actually watched the breeders at work. These special events would not be likely to cast any fossily shadows into the future. To take a simpler variation on our thought experiment, suppose we were to send "Martian" biologists a laying hen, a Pekingese dog, a barn swallow, and a cheetah and ask them to determine which designs bore the mark of intervention by artificial selectors. What could they rely on? How would they argue? They might note that the hen did not care "properly" for her eggs; some varieties of hen have had their instinct for broodiness bred right out of them, and would soon become extinct were it not for the environment of artificial incubators human beings have provided for them. They might note that the Pekingese was pathetically ill-equipped to fend for itself in any demanding environment they could imagine. But the barn swallow's innate fondness for carpentered nest sites might fool them into the view that it was some sort of pet, and whatever features of the cheetah convinced them that it was a creature of the wild might also be found in greyhounds, and be features we know to have been patiently encouraged by breeders. Artificial environments are themselves a part of nature, after all, so it is unlikely that there are any clear signs of artificial selection that can be read off an organism in the absence of insider information on the actual history that created the organism.*

**If the creature couldn't survive in any environment where they're not a pet, that'd be a signal of artificial breeding. Although artificial breeding happens naturally as well, just think of the farming ants.

*The deeper problem lies with the nature of the information in the DNA. As we have seen, our system of embryological development takes DNA sequences as a recipe, not a blueprint. There is no point-for-point mapping between body parts and DNA parts. This is what makes it extremely unlikely — or in some cases impossible — that any particular acquired change in a body part (in a muscle or a beak or, in the case of behavior, a neural control circuit of some sort) will correspond to any discrete change in the organism's DNA. So, even if there were a way of getting a change order sent to the sex cells, there would be no way of composing the necessary change order.*

**Couldn't knowing what changes to the DNA simply be mediated by what genes have been activated in the parent?

*Almost always, the issue in evolutionary theory is not possibility in principle, but relative importance, and the issues are always much more complex than I have portrayed them.*

*"What's good for the body is good for the genes and vice versa." By and large, biologists would agree, this must be true. The fate of a body and the fate of its genes are tightly linked. But they are not perfectly coincident. What about those cases when push comes to shove, and the interests of the body (long life, happiness, comfort, etc.) conflict with the interests of the genes?*

**Let's not forget group and lineage as well.

*Natural selection is not a force that "acts" at one level — for instance, the molecular level as opposed to the population level or organism level. Natural selection occurs because a sum of events, of all sorts and sizes, has a particular statistically describable outcome. The blue whale teeters on the brink of extinction; if it goes extinct, a particularly magnificent and almost impossible to replace set of volumes in the Library of Mendel will cease to have extant copies, but the factor that best explains why those characteristic chromosomes, or collections of DNA nucleotide sequences, vanish from the earth might be a virus that somehow directly attacked the DNA-replicating machinery in the whales, a stray comet landing near the pod of the survivors at just the wrong time, or a surfeit of television publicity, causing curious humans to interfere catastrophically with their breeding habits!*

**The statistical patterns at each level seem to me to be a great determiner of that level's explanatory power and importance.

*(with such loaded words as "barren"), and it is true that it is a reversal of the fundamental strategy of all life, but, still, it often happens. We recognize that bearing and raising offspring is just one of life's possible projects, and by no means the most important, given our values. But where could those values have come from? How did our control systems become equipped with them, if not by miraculous surgery? How is it that we have been able to establish a rival perspective that can often overpower our genes' interests while other species have not?*

**That's why meme is such an important concept, they really have taken over from genes. If the only thing left in a million years are robots and AI then the memes will truly have supplanted genes as the ultimate carrier of accumulated creation. It is perhaps the capacity for memes to survive and replicate that separated us from the rest of the biosphere. What is that magical threshold of capacity or innovation that allowed for it? What made genes viable? Is the situation similar with memes?

*Human culture, as we have already seen, is not just a crane composed of cranes, but a crane-making crane. Culture is such a powerful set of cranes that its effects can swamp many — but not all — of the earlier genetic pressures and processes that created it and still coexist with it.*

**It's the recursiveness that allowed us to set of exponential loops in design. What put us over the edge for that?

*How much of this rapid change in height is due to genetic changes in our species? Not much, if any at all. There has been time for only about ten generations of Homo sapiens since Old Ironsides was launched in 1797, and even if there were a strong selection pressure favoring the tall — and is there evidence for that? — this would not have had time to produce such a big effect. What have changed dramatically are human health, diet, and living conditions; these are what have produced the dramatic change in phenotype, which is 100 percent due to cultural innovations, passed on through cultural transmission: schooling, the spread of new farming practices, public-health measures, and so forth. Anyone who worries about "genetic determinism" should be reminded that virtually all the differences discernible between the people of, say, Plato's day and the people living today — their physical talents, proclivities, attitudes, prospects — must be due to cultural changes, since fewer than two hundred generations separate us from Plato. Environmental changes due to cultural innovations change the landscape of phenotypic expression so much, and so fast, however, that they can in principle change the genetic selection pressures rapidly — the Baldwin Effect is a simple instance of such a change in selection pressure due to widespread behavioral innovation. Although it is important to remember how slowly evolution works in general, we should  {339}  never forget that there is no inertia at all in selection pressure. Pressures that have been dominant for millions of years can vanish overnight; and, of course, new selection pressures can come into existence with a single volcanic eruption, or the appearance of a new disease organism.*

**The changes that we see in our phenotype, are most likely due to cultural evolution and its changes on the environment and our behavior if it happens in a short time span. Our genes have dormant capacities that are hard to predict.

*But why does sleep need a "clear biological function" at all? It is being awake that needs an explanation, and presumably its explanation is obvious. Animals — unlike plants — need to be awake at least part of the time, in order to search for food and procreate, as Raymo notes. But once you've headed down this path of leading an active existence, the cost-benefit analysis of the options that arise is far from obvious. Being awake is relatively costly, compared with lying dormant (think of its root, dormire). So presumably Mother Nature economizes where she can. If we could get away with it, we'd "sleep" our entire lives. That is what trees do, after all: all winter they "hibernate" in deep coma, because there is nothing else for them to do, and in the summer they "estivate" in a somewhat lighter coma, in what the doctors call a vegetative state when a member of our species has the misfortune to enter it.*

**Nature is cleverer than you are. There will be an adaptionist explanation since the proof is in the pudding.

*Then, one day, according to Lynn Margulis' wonderful story (1981), some prokaryotes were invaded by parasites of sorts, and this turned out to be a blessing in disguise, for, whereas parasites are — by definition — deleterious to the fitness of their hosts, these invaders turned out to be beneficial, and hence were symbionts but not parasites. They and those they invaded became more like commensals — literally, from the Latin, organisms that feed at the same table — or mutualists, benefiting from each other's company. They joined forces, creating a revolutionary new kind of entity, a eukaryotic cell. This opened up the Vast space of possibilities we know as multicellular life, a space previously unimaginable, to say the least; prokaryotes are no doubt clueless on all topics.  {341} 
Then a few billion years passed, while multicellular life forms explored various nooks and crannies of Design Space until, one fine day, another invasion began, in a single species of multicellular organism, a sort of primate, which had developed a variety of structures and capacities (don't you dare call them preadaptations) that just happened to be particularly well suited for these invaders. It is not surprising that the invaders were well adapted for finding homes in their hosts, since they were themselves created by their hosts, in much the way spiders create webs and birds create nests. In a twinkling — less than a hundred thousand years — these new invaders transformed the apes who were their unwitting hosts into something altogether new: witting hosts, who, thanks to their huge stock of newfangled invaders, could imagine the heretofore unimaginable, leaping through Design Space as nothing had ever done before. Following Dawkins (1976), I call the invaders memes, and the radically new kind of entity created when a particular sort of animal is properly furnished by — or infested with — memes is what is commonly called a person.*

**How did these invaders evolve? What's their origin? What about the host made it possible for them to be invaded?

*to show how memes could transform the operating system or computational architecture of a human brain. That account offers many details about the relationship between the genetically designed hardware of the human brain and the culturally transmitted habits that transform it into something much more powerful*

**Imagine being able to install software on a computer by explaining an idea. Thinking tools are peculiar kinds of software. We have many one off programs for many specific situations, but we also have many that are quite generalized and that the specifics can be situated in. What's the process of installing a new meme, how does it get attached to what's already there, what does the general outline of installed memes look like, what new capacity can it give us?

*The outlines of the theory of evolution by natural selection make clear that evolution occurs whenever the following conditions exist:
(1) variation: there is a continuing abundance of different elements
(2) heredity or replication: the elements have the capacity to create copies or replicas of themselves
(3) differential "fitness": the number of copies of an element that are created in a given time varies, depending on interactions between the features of that element and features of the environment in which it persists*

**Ping! A good summary of the prerequisites for evolution.

Page: 473

*In between the extremes lie the likely and valuable prospects, that there is a large (or largish) and important (or merely mildly interesting) transfer of concepts from biology to the human sciences. It might be, for example, that, although the processes of cultural transmission of ideas are truly Darwinian phenomena, for various reasons they resist being captured in a Darwinian science, so we will have to settle for the "merely philosophical" realizations we can glean from this, and leave science to tackle other projects.*

**Wouldn't it be very useful to establish a science for this? Imagine if we had precise control over how memes mutate and are transfered. 

---
Page: 475

*Human language, first spoken and then, very recently, written, is surely the principal medium of cultural transmission, creating the infosphere in which cultural evolution occurs. Speaking and hearing, writing and reading — these are the underlying technologies of transmission and replication most analogous to the technologies of DNA and RNA in the biosphere. I needn't bother reviewing the familiar facts about the recent explosive proliferation of these media via the memes for movable type, radio and television, xerography, computers, fax machines, and electronic mail. We are all well aware that today we live awash in a sea of paper-borne memes, breathing in an atmosphere of electronically-borne memes. Memes now spread around the world at the speed of light, and replicate at rates that make even fruit flies and yeast cells look glacial in comparison. They leap promiscuously from vehicle to vehicle, and from medium to medium, and are proving to be virtually unquarantinable.*

**Memes can be perfectly replicated in terms of their code, but the diversity of minds that they end up in can cause quite a lot of interpretation errors. What are the error correction mechanisms that memes work with? 

---
Page: 477

*Minds are in limited supply, and each mind has a limited capacity for memes, and hence there is a considerable competition among memes for entrv into as many minds as possible. This competition is the major selective force in the infosphere, and, just as in the biosphere, the challenge has been met with great ingenuity. "Whose ingenuity?" you may want to ask, but by now you should know that this is not always a good question; the ingenuity is there to appreciate, whatever its source. Like a mindless virus, a meme's prospects depend on its design — not its "internal" design, whatever that might be, but the design it shows the world, its phenotype, the way it affects things in its environment. The things in its environment are minds and other memes.*

**How do memes interact with other memes? How do they compete? 

---
Page: 477

*For instance, whatever virtues (from our perspective) the following memes have, they have in common the property of having phenotypic expressions that tend to make their own replication more likely by disabling or preempting the environmental forces that would tend to extinguish them: the meme for faith, which discourages the exercise of the sort of critical judgment that might decide that the idea of faith was, all things considered, a dangerous idea (Dawkins 1976, p. 212); the memes for tolerance, or free speech; the meme for including a warning in a chain letter about the terrible fates of those who have broken the chain in the past; the conspiracy-theory meme, which has a built-in response to the objection that there is no good evidence of the conspiracy: "Of course not — that's how powerful the conspiracy is!" Some of these memes are "good," and others "bad"; what they have in common is a phenotypic effect that systematically tends to disable the selective forces arrayed against them.*

**Some memes actively squash out other memes that it deems as threatening. 

---
Page: 480

*In other words, the memes for editing and criticism will find niches in any environment in the infosphere; they flourish because of the short supply and limited capacity of minds, whatever the transmission media between minds. Do you doubt this prediction? If so, I'd like to discuss framing a suitable wager with you. Here once again, as we have seen so often in evolutionary thinking, explanation proceeds by an assumption that the processes — whatever their media, and whatever the contingent zigs and zags of their particular trajectories — will home in on the forced moves and other Good Tricks in the relevant space.
The structure of filters is complex and quick to respond to new challenges, but of course it doesn't always "work." The competition among memes to break through the filters leads to an "arms race" of ploy and counterploy, with ever more elaborate "advertising" raised against ever more layers of selective filters.*

**It would've been interesting to hear Dennett's take on the attention economy. He kind of predicts it here, there will be an escalating arms race for occupancy in our minds. We're lagging behind with the filters at the moment. Perhaps personal AIs and shifting attitudes will help us sort that out. We could also be in a position where some memes and meme producers will reach world domination.

Page: 485

*It is conceivable, but hardly likely and certainly not necessary, that we will someday discover a striking identity between brain structures storing the same information, allowing us to identify memes syntactically. Even if we encountered such an unlikely blessing, however, we should cling to the more abstract and fundamental concept of memes, since we already know that meme transmission and storage can proceed indefinitely in noncerebral forms — in artifacts of every kind — that do not depend on a shared language of description. If ever there was "multimedia" transmission and transformation of information, it is cultural transmission and transformation. So some of the varieties of reductionistic triumph we have come to expect in biology — discovering exactly how many different ways hemoglobin is "spelled" in all the species in the world, for instance — are almost certainly ruled out in any science of culture, notwithstanding the prophecies of a golden age of mind-reading one sometimes hears these days from the ideologues of neuroscience.*

**Cultural artifacts have no fixed representation, the semantics is decoupled from the syntax.

Page: 486

*Darwinian evolution, as we have seen, depends on very high-fidelity copying — almost but not quite perfect copying, thanks to the exquisite proofreading and duplication machinery of the DNA-readers that accompany the DNA texts. Raise the mutation rate just a bit too high and evolution goes haywire; natural selection can no longer work to guarantee fitness over the long run. Minds (or brains), on the other hand, aren't much like photocopying machines at all. On the contrary,  {355}  instead of just dutifully passing on their messages, correcting most of the typos as they go, brains seem to be designed to do just the opposite: to transform, invent, interpolate, censor, and generally mix up the "input" before yielding any "output." Isn't one of the hallmarks of cultural evolution and transmission the extraordinarily high rate of mutation and recombination? We seldom pass on a meme unaltered, it seems, unless we are particularly literal-minded rote learners. (Are walking encyclopedias hidebound?) Moreover, as Steven Pinker has stressed (personal communication), much of the mutation that happens to memes — how much is not clear — is manifestly directed mutation: "Memes such as the theory of relativity are not the cumulative product of millions of random (undirected) mutations of some original idea, but each brain in the chain of production added huge dollops of value to the product in a nonrandom way." Indeed, the whole power of minds as meme nests comes from what a biologist would call lineage-crossing or anastomosis (the coming back together of separating gene-pools). As Gould (1991a, p. 65) points out, "The basic topologies of biological and cultural change are completely different. Biological evolution is a system of constant divergence without subsequent joining of branches. Lineages, once distinct, are separate forever. In human history, transmission across lineages is, perhaps, the major source of cultural change."*

**Looking at the characteristics of Darwinian evolution may be a step backwards. Perhaps one should try and capture ideas from cultural evolution instead? 

---
Page: 488

*What is in common, of course, is not a syntactic property or system of properties but a semantic property or system of properties: the story, not the text; the characters and their personalities, not their names and speeches. What we so readily identify as the same thing in both cases is the predicament that both William Shakespeare and Arthur Laurents (who wrote the book for West Side Story) want us to think about. So it is only at the level of intentional objects, once we have adopted the intentional stance, that we can describe these common properties.7 When we do adopt the stance, the sought-for common features often stick out like sore thumbs.*

**There are real changes to dynamics between objects at different levels of reality. The further from the base layer, the more free flowing, fuzzy and fast it seems to get. Can there be a level beyond the intentional object one?

*Anthropologists looking for evidence of shared culture are, quite properly, more impressed by common idiosyncrasies of decorative style than by common functional shapes. Or consider the fact that two widely separated cultures both used boats; this is no evidence at all of a shared cultural heritage. If both cultures were to paint eyes on the bows of their boats, it would be much more interesting, but still a rather obvious move in the game of design. If both cultures were to paint, say, blue hexagons on the bows of their boats, this would be telling indeed.*

**The vastness of Design space will make idiosyncrasies and unlikely combinations stick out more when it comes to determining origins.

Page: 490

*What Sperber says about the indirectness of the role of the abstract features is certainly true, but, far from this being an obstacle to science, it is the best sort of invitation to science: an invitation to cut through the Gordian knot of tangled causation with an abstract formulation that is predictive precisely because it ignores all those complications. For instance, genes are selected because of their indirect and only statistically visible phenotypic effects. Consider the following prediction: wherever you find moths with camouflage on their wings, you will find that they have keen-sighted predators, and wherever you find moths that are heavily predated by echo-locating bats, you will find that they have traded in wing camouflage for jamming devices or a particular talent for creating evasive flight patterns. Of course, our ultimate goal is to explain whatever features we find in the moths and their surroundings all the way down to the molecular or atomic mechanisms responsible, but there is no reason to demand that such a reduction be uniform or generalizable across the board. It is the glory of science that it can find the patterns in spite of the noise (Dennett 1991b).*

**We need to do work on the problem formulation just as much as the problem itself. We need to think of the right questions. There seems to be an opportunity for great discoveries in the workings of cultural creation.

*So what is this mind of ours: what are these atoms with consciousness? Last week's potatoes! They now can remember what was going on in my mind a year ago — a mind which has long ago been replaced.
To note that the thing I call my individuality is only a pattern or dance, that is what it means when one discovers how long it takes for the atoms of the brain to be replaced by other atoms. The atoms come into my brain, dance a dance, and then go out — there are always new atoms, but always doing the same dance, remembering what the dance was yesterday.*

**Where is the choreography setup and how are new atoms onboarded to it?

---
Page: 493

*In the end, we want to know the answers to all these questions, but in the meantime there is a lot we can do in the substrate-neutral domain of pure information transfer. In cognitive science, for example, the linguist Ray Jackendoflf (1987, 1993) shows the surprising power of this method in his ingenious deductions about the number of representational levels, and their powers, that must go into such tasks as getting information from the light that strikes our eyes all the way to places where we can talk about what we see. He doesn't have to know the details of neurophysiology (though he's interested, unlike many other linguists) in order to reach confident and reliable conclusions about the structure of the processes, and the representations they transform.*

**I want to know what is known about different levels of representation. Ray Jackendoflf may be a good start. 

**Some memes seem to have an easier time to repair themselves. Certain misspellings of words for example are easy to spot. 

---
Page: 491

*Here is Sperber's "Law of the Epidemiology of Representations":
In an oral tradition, all cultural representations are easily remembered ones; hard to remember representations are forgotten, or transformed into more easily remembered ones, before reaching a cultural level of distribution. [Sperber 1985, p. 86.]  {359} 
It looks trivial at first, but consider how we can apply it. We can use the existence of a particular sort of cultural representation endemic to oral traditions to shed light on how human memory works, by asking what it is about this sort of representation that makes it more memorable than others.*

**The digital world has to have quite the impact on the fitness landscape for memes. The tools we have for interacting with certain representations seem important too. 

---
Page: 497

*The most important point Dawkins makes, then, is that there is no necessary connection between a meme's replicative power, its "fitness" from its point of view, and its contribution to our fitness (by whatever standard we judge that). This is an unsettling observation, but the situation is not totally desperate. Although some memes definitely manipulate us into collaborating on their replication in spite of our judging them useless or ugly or even dangerous to our health and welfare, many — most, if we are lucky — of the memes that replicate themselves do so not just with our blessings but because of our esteem for them.*

**Could we classify memes in terms of their usefulness to our fitness regardless of whether their fitness is correlated with our fitness? 

---
Page: 503

*I am not saying that because the priest's body is "doomed" to sire no offspring, this is a bad or "unnatural" thing. That would be to side with our selfish genes, which is exactly what we don't want to do. I am saying that this is just the most extreme, and hence vivid, example of the process that has made us all: our selves have been created out of the interplay of memes exploiting and redirecting the machinery Mother Nature has given us. My brain harbors the memes for celibacy and chastity (I couldn't write about them otherwise), but they never managed to get into the driver's seat in me. I do not identify with them. My brain also harbors the meme for fasting or dieting, and I wish I could get it more often into the driver's seat (so that I could more wholeheartedly diet), but, for one reason or another, the coalitions of memes that would incorporate the meme for dieting into my whole "heart" seldom form a government with long-term stability. No one  {368}  meme rules anybody; what makes a person the person he or she is are the coalitions of memes that govern — that play the long-term roles in determining which decisions are made along the way.*

**Some memes are entirely dependent on other memes for them to become activated. The fasting meme might not be activated unless you have a particular body image meme. 

---
Page: 499

*Fortunately for us, there is a nonrandom correlation between the two perspectives, just as there is between what is good for General Motors and what is good for America. It is no accident that the memes that replicate tend to be good for us, not for our biological fitness (Williams' sardonic commentary on the churchgoers is absolutely right on that score), but for whatever it is we hold dear.11 And never forget the crucial point: the facts  {365}  about whatever we hold dear — our highest values — are themselves very much a product of the memes that have spread most successfully. We may want to claim that we are in charge of what our summum bonum is to be, but this is mystical nonsense unless we admit that what we are (and hence what we might persuade ourselves to consider the summum bonum) is itself something we have learned to be, in outgrowing our animal heritage. Biology puts some constraint on what we could value; in the long run, we would not survive unless we had a better-than-chance habit of choosing the memes that help us, but we haven't seen the long run yet. Mother Nature's experiment with culture on this planet is only a few thousand generations old. Nevertheless, we have good reason to believe that our meme-immunological systems are not hopeless — even if they are not foolproof. We can rely, as a general, crude rule of thumb, on the coincidence of the two perspectives: by and large, the good memes — good by our standards — will tend to be the ones that are also the good replicators.*

**Our ideas will impact our survival. The question is if there are any particular genes that are the foundation for having certain kinds of ideas. Openness and creativity and language are all traits affected by our genes. Our survival is sometimes very much dependent on the types of ideas we can have but perhaps more importantly the ideas that we as a group can have. The social influence on memes would be interesting to dig into. The reputation of a person spreading a meme will affect its effectiveness.

Page: 500

*The haven all memes depend on reaching is the human mind, but a human mind is itself an artifact created when memes restructure a human brain in order to make it a better habitat for memes. The avenues for entry and departure are modified to suit local conditions, and strengthened by various artificial devices that enhance fidelity and prolixity of replication: native Chinese minds differ dramatically from native French minds, and literate minds differ from illiterate minds. What memes provide in return to tile organisms in which they reside is an incalculable store of advantages — with some Trojan horses thrown in for good measure, no doubt. Normal human brains are not all alike; they vary considerably in size, shape, and the myriad details of connection on which their prowess depends. But the most striking differences in human prowess depend on microstructural differences (still inscrutable to neuroscience) induced by the various memes that have entered them and taken up residence. The memes enhance each other's opportunities: the meme for education, for instance, is a meme that reinforces the very process of meme implantation.*

**Our genetic variety is triumphed by our memetic variety. And the memetic variety seems to be ever changing.

Page: 508

*More theoretically minded critics have deplored his faintheartedness from the opposite pole: how could such a sound, ingenious mechanist flinch so badly when it came to making an exception for humanity? Of course our minds are our brains, and hence are ultimately just stupendously complex "machines"; the difference between us and other animals is one of huge degree, not metaphysical kind. It is no coincidence, I have shown, that those who deplore Artificial Intelligence are also those who deplore evolutionary accounts of human mentality: if human minds are  {371}  nonmiraculous products of evolution, then they are, in the requisite sense, artifacts, and all their powers must have an ultimately "mechanical" explanation. We are descended from macros and made of macros, and nothing we can do is anything beyond the power of huge assemblies of macros (assembled in space and time).*

**Being able to explain the mind does not diminish it, when we find the explanation, oh how beautiful and simple it shall be.

*A series of ever more powerful types of mind can be defined in terms of the Tower of Generate-and-Test, which takes us from the crudest trial-and-error learners to the community of scientists and other serious human thinkers.*

**Generate and test is not to be underestimated. Test is certainly where the intelligence is, and we haven't been able to automate it just yet. 

---
Page: 508

*Still, there is a huge difference between our minds and the minds of other species, a gulf wide enough even to make a moral difference. It is — it must be — due to two intermeshed factors, each of which requires a Darwinian explanation: (1) the brains we are born with have features lacking in other brains, features that have evolved under selection pressure over the last six million years or so, and (2) these features make possible an enormous elaboration of powers that accrue from the sharing of Design wealth through cultural transmission. The pivotal phenomenon that unites these two factors is language. We human beings may not be the most admirable species on the planet, or the most likely to survive for another millennium, but we are without any doubt at all the most intelligent. We are also the only species with language.*

**What about language makes it the ultimate enabler for cultural transmission? Couldn't there be other transmission mechanisms that are very different? 

---
Page: 509

*This admiration for language — real language, the sort only we human beings use — is well founded. The expressive, information-encoding properties of real language are practically limitless (in at least some dimensions), and the powers that other species acquire in virtue of their use of proto-languages, hemi-semi-demi-languages, are indeed similar to the powers we acquire thanks to our use of real language. These other species do climb a few steps up the mountain on whose summit we reside, thanks to language. Looking at the vast differences between their gains and ours is one way of approaching the question we now must address: just how does language contribute to intelligence?*

**What is beyond language? Or is it a threshold beyond which there's no more juice to be squeezed, apart from speed perhaps? Maybe the threshold is a kind of universality in being able to capture anything in a transmissable format?

---
Page: 509

*What varieties of thought require language? What varieties of thought (if any) are possible without language?*

**There's a certain pattern matching intuition that precedes verbalizing. Although that in itself may be dependent on self-prompting the mind with verbal language.

*The bird is (apparently) endowed with a collection of interlocking special-purpose minimalist subroutines, well designed by evolution according to the notorious need-to-know principle of espionage: give each agent as little information as will suffice for it to accomplish its share of the mission.
Control systems designed under this principle can be astonishingly successful — witness the birds' nests, after all — whenever the environment has enough simplicity and regularity, and hence predictability, to favor pre-design of the whole system. The system's very design in effect makes a prediction — a wager, in fact — that the environment will be the way it must be for the system to work. When the complexity of encountered environments rises, however, and unpredictability becomes a more severe problem, a different design principle kicks in: the commando-team principle, illustrated by such films as The Guns of Navarone, give each agent as much knowledge about the total project as possible, so that the team has a chance of ad-libbing appropriately when unanticipated obstacles arise.*

**We've seen this in technology as well. At first we had a specialized computer for every little task we wanted to so, but at some point the general purpose chips become powerful and importantly cheap enough to be more appropriate to use everywhere. There's a little bit of similarity in nature with eyes, a spider has many eyes, each of which is special purpose. Perhaps that is because its brain wouldn't be able to multiplex the functions necessary for survival through the same eye. And perhaps that's why animals only have two eyes, their brains are powerful enough to make general use of its hardware. What if the dynamics in an insect are wholly different from the ones in an animal?

---
Page: 513

*This process went through many millions of cycles, producing many wonderful designs, both plant and animal, and eventually among its novel creations were some designs with the property of phenotypic plasticity. The individual candidate organisms were not wholly designed at birth, or, in other words, there were elements of their design that could be adjusted by events that occurred during the field tests. (This is what makes the Baldwin Effect possible, as we saw in chapter 3, but now we are going to focus on the intra-organismic design that sets up that crane.) Some of these candidates, we may suppose, were no better off than their hard-wired cousins, since they had no way of favoring (selecting for an encore) the behavioral options they were equipped to "try out," but others, we may suppose, were fortunate enough to have wired-in "reinforcers" that happened to favor Smart Moves, actions that were better for their agents. These individuals thus confronted the environment by generating a variety of actions, which they tried out, one by one, until they found one that worked. We may call this subset of Darwinian creatures, the creatures with conditionable plasticity, Skinnerian creatures, since, as B. F. Skinner was fond of pointing out, operant conditioning is not just analogous to Darwinian natural selection; it is continuous with it. "Where inherited behavior leaves off, the inherited modifiability of the process of conditioning takes over" (Skinner 1953, p. 83).*

**Evolution had to make many tries before it could create evolution at the next level. It's so interesting to think of our own behavior through an evolutionary lense. It makes it much more dynamic and it also speaks to the importance of the selective pressure that you put on your own behaviors. It also gives you the chance to explain your own behaviors. 

---
Page: 514

*We human beings are creatures capable of this third refinement, but we are not alone. We may call the beneficiaries of this third story in the Tower Popperian creatures, since, as Sir Karl Popper once elegantly put it, this design enhancement "permits our hypotheses to die in our stead." Unlike the merely Skinnerian creatures, many of whom survive only because they make lucky first moves, Popperian creatures survive because they're smart enough to make better-than-chance first moves. Of course, they're just lucky to be smart, but that's better than just being lucky.*

**This is where I'd tie Dennett, Deutsche and Vervaeke together. We're universal explainers and we can operate in memetic space, and the way we operate there is through our ability for relevance realization which itself is driven by evolutionary principles in our own minds and across minds. 

**Physical creatures go to behavioral creatures go to thinking creatures.

*But how is this preselection in Popperian agents to be done? Where is the feedback to come from? It must come from a sort of inner environment — an inner something-or-other that is structured in such a way that the surrogate actions it favors are more often than not the very actions the real world would also bless, if they were actually performed. In short, the inner environment, whatever it is, must contain lots of information about the outer environment and its regularities. Nothing else (except magic) could provide preselection  {376}  worth having. Now, here we must be very careful not to think of this inner environment as simply a replica of the outer world, with all its physical contingencies reproduced. (In such a miraculous toy world, the little hot stove in your head would be hot enough actually to burn the little finger in your head that you placed on it!) The information about the world has to be there, but it also has to be structured in such a way that there is a nonmiraculous explanation of how it got there, how it is maintained, and how it actually achieves the preselective effects that are its raison d'etre.*

**How do we form our world model? How do we interact with it? How does it affect our behavior? The principles by which it is governed ought to be similar to those at the physical and behavioral level, i.e they involve some evolutionary mechanism.

*What happens to a human or hominid brain when it becomes equipped with words? In particular, what is the shape of this environment when words first enter it? It is definitely not an even playing field or a tabula rasa. Our newfound words must anchor themselves on the hills and valleys of a landscape of considerable complexity. Thanks to earlier evolutionary pressures, our innate quality spaces are species-specific, narcissistic, and even idiosyncratic from individual to individual. A number of investigators are currently exploring portions of this terrain. The psychologist Frank Keil (1992) and his colleagues at Cornell have evidence that certain highly abstract concepts — such as the concepts of being alive or ownership, for instance — have a genetically imposed head start in the young child's kit of mind-tools; when the specific words for owning, giving and taking, keeping  {379}  and hiding, and their kin enter a child's brain, they find homes already partially built for them.*

**What is the set of prerequisite knowledge anchors needed for a language to form? It has to be based on a rather small set of things that can be combined a near infinite amount of times.

*The successors to mere Popperian creatures are those whose inner environments are informed by the designed portions of the outer environment. We may call this sub-sub-subset of Darwinian creatures Gregorian creatures, since the British psychologist Richard Gregory is to my mind the preeminent theorist of the role of information (or, more exactly, what Gregory calls Potential Intelligence) in the creation of Smart Moves (or what Gregory calls Kinetic Intelligence). Gregory observes that a pair of scissors, as a well-designed artifact, is not just a result of intelligence, but an endower of intelligence (external Potential Intelligence), in a very straight-forward and intuitive sense: when you give someone a pair of scissors, you enhance his potential to arrive more safely and swiftly at Smart Moves (Gregory 1981, pp. 31 Iff).*

**Our ability to absorb and embody tools, is that something new? Can other animals make things become extensions of themselves? When animals use sticks for example, it looks weirdly clunky, like they don't have a connection with it.

*The advent of high-speed still photography was a revolutionary technological advance for science because it permitted human beings, for the first time, to examine complicated temporal phenomena not in real time but in their own good time — in leisurely, methodical backtracking analysis of the traces they had created of those complicated events. Here a technological advance carried in its wake a huge enhancement in cognitive power. The advent of language was an exactly parallel boon for human beings, a technology that created a whole new class of objects-to-contemplate, verbally embodied surrogates that could be reviewed in any order at any pace. And this opened up a new dimension of self-improvement — all one had to do was learn to savor one's own mistakes.
Science, however, is not just a matter of making mistakes, but of making mistakes in public. Making mistakes for all to see, in the hopes of getting the others to help with the corrections.*

**Language gives us the ability to view information discretely at our own pace. Science is a way of structuring how information is transmitted. This next level is what fueled the enlightenment that took us to where we are today.

*Let me sum up the results of this rather swift survey. Our human brains, and only human brains, have been armed by habits and methods, mind-tools and information, drawn from millions of other brains which are not ancestral to our own brains. This, amplified by the deliberate, foresightful use of generate-and-test in science, puts our minds on a different plane from the minds of our nearest relatives among the animals. This species-specific process of enhancement has become so swift and powerful that a single generation of its design improvements can now dwarf the R-and-D efforts of millions of years of evolution by natural selection. Comparing our brains anatomically with chimpanzee brains (or dolphin brains or any other non-human brains) would be almost beside the point, because our brains are in effect joined together into a single cognitive system that dwarfs all others. They are joined by an innovation that has invaded our brains and no others: language. I am not making the foolish claim that all our brains are knit together by language into one gigantic mind, thinking its transnational thoughts, but, rather, that each individual human brain, thanks to its communicative links, is the beneficiary of the cognitive labors of the others in a way that gives it unprecedented powers.*

**Our ability to have a collective intelligence and to share it is owerpowered. We are the beneficiaries of it in too many ways to count. All of our thinking tools, all of our social tools, all of our physical tools. They all increase our capacity to make further tools. It's a positive feedback loop. Truly a crane for building other cranes.

*In other moods, they have both (correctly) hailed the capacity of the human brain to "parse," and hence presumably understand, the official infinity of grammatical sentences of a natural language such as English. If we can understand all the sentences (in principle), couldn't we understand the ordered sets of sentences that best express the solutions to the problems of free will and consciousness? After all, one of the volumes in the Library of Babel is — must be — the best statement in fewer than five hundred pages of short grammatical English sentences of the solution to the problem of free will, and another is the optimal job in English on consciousness.*

**If it can be explained, we can understand it. What about the ineffable? What about the things that are best understood mathematically? We have to be careful here not to only think of propositional knowing. 

---
Page: 525

*We certainly cannot rule out the possibility in principle that our minds will be cognitively closed to some domain or other. In fact, as we shall see in more detail in chapter 15, we can be certain that there are realms of no doubt fascinating and important knowledge that our species, in its actual finitude, will never enter, not because we will butt our heads against some stone wall of utter incomprehension, but because the Heat Death of the universe will overtake us before we can get there. This is not, however, a limitation due to the frailty of our animal brains, a dictate of "naturalism." On the contrary, a proper application of Darwinian thinking suggests that if we survive our current self-induced environmental crises, our capacity to comprehend will continue to grow by increments that are now incomprehensible to us.
Why shouldn't Chomsky and Fodor and McGinn love this conclusion? It grants to human minds — and only to human minds — an indefinitely expanding dominion over the puzzles and problems of the universe, with no limits in sight. What could be more wonderful than that? The trouble is, I suspect, that they deem the means to be unsatisfactory; if the mind's power is due to cranes, not skyhooks, they would just as soon settle for mystery.*

**Dennett and Deutsche overlap heavily here. I do have to be careful though not to equivocate too much between them. In fact, where would they disagree? 

---
Page: 537

*Many people have argued that the evolution of the human language faculty cannot be explained by Darwinian natural selection. Chomsky and Gould have suggested that language may have evolved as the by-product of selection for other abilities or as a consequence of as-yet unknown laws of growth and form.... [W]e conclude that there is every reason to believe that a specialization for grammar evolved by a conventional neo-Darwinian process. [Pinker and Bloom 1990, p. 707]*

**What if language isn't the bedrock for the mind? What if there are other capacities of the brain that are more fundamental to a mind? I believe our ability to inhabit tools may be one of those.

Page: 541

*This explains his misconstrual of my friendly suggestion about passing the buck to biology. I was assuming, as a good Spencerian adaptationist, that "genes are the channel through which the environment speaks," as Godfrey-Smith puts it, whereas Chomsky prefers to think of the genes' getting their message from some intrinsic, ahistorical, nonenvironmental source of organization — "physics," we may call it Spencerians think that even if there are such timeless "laws of form," they could impose themselves on things only through some selectional process or other.*

**The Spencerian view contains historicity which reminds me of Lee Cronin's Assembly Theory that takes complexity over time very seriously.

*Today the reigning orthodoxy in cognitive science is that yesterday's simple models of perception, learning, memory, language production, and language understanding are orders of magnitude too simple, but those simple models were often nice tries, without which we would still be wondering how simple it might, after all, turn out to be. It makes sense to err on the side of greedy reductionism, to try for the simple model before wallowing around in complexities. Mendel's simple genetics was a nice try, and so was the rather more complex "bean-bag genetics" it became in the hands of population geneticists, even though it has often relied on such retrospectively outrageous oversimplifications that Francis Crick was tempted to kick it out of science. Graham Cairns-Smith's clay crystals are a nice try, and Art Samuel's checkers-player was a nice try — much too simple, as we learned, but on the right track.*

**Exploration is iterative and you cannot be expected to get it perfectly right on the first iteration. Each iteration generates a new set of problems to be solved.

*This, by the way, already makes a problem for Searle's view that only artifacts can have functions, and those are the functions its creators endow it with by their very special mental acts of creation. The original designers of the two-bitser may have been entirely oblivious of some later use to which it was opportunistically exapted, so their intentions count for nothing. And the new selectors may also fail to formulate any specific intentions — they may just fall into the habit of relying on the two-bitser for some handy function, unaware of the act of unconscious exaptation they are jointly executing. Recall that Darwin, in Origin, already drew attention to unconscious selection of traits in domestic animals; unconscious selection of traits in artifacts is no stretch at all; it is rather a frequent event, one might suppose*

**Might one not say that the user is also part of designing the artifact? They design it by using it a particular way.

*Unless there were "meaningless" or "indeterminate" variation in the triggering conditions of the various frogs' eyes, there could be no raw material (blind variation) for selection for a new purpose to act upon. The indeterminacy that Fodor (and others) see as a flaw in Darwinian accounts of the evolution of meaning is actually a precondition for any such evolution. The idea that there must be something determinate that the frog's eye really means — some possibly unknowable proposition in froggish that expresses exactly what the frog's eye is telling the frog's brain — is just essentialism applied to meaning (or function). Meaning, like function, on which it so directly depends, is not something determinate at its birth. It arises not by saltation or special creation, but by a (typically gradual) shift of circumstances.*

**Meaning itself is a complex adaptive system involving function, environment, adaptation and so on. Can one apply that to psychological notions of meaning? Then it moves to more of a memetic question.

---
Page: 563

*But there is another way of thinking of the same example. Nothing forces us to suppose that your concept of a horse wasn't more relaxed in the first place, rather like your concept of a table. (Try telling the story of Twin Earth with the suggestion that the tables there aren't really tables, but just look like tables and are used for tables. It doesn't work, does it?) Horses and schmorses may not be the same biological species, but what if you, like most Earthlings, have no clear concept of species, and classify by appearance: living thing that looks like Man-o-War. Horses and schmorses both fall into that kind, so, when you call a Twin Earth beast a horse, you're right after all. Given what you mean by "horse," schmorses are horses — a non-Earthly kind of horse, but a horse just the same. Non-Earthly tables are tables, too. It is clear that you could have such a relaxed concept of horses, and that you could have a tighter concept, according to which schmorses are not horses, not being of the same Earthly species. Both cases are possible. Now, must it be determinate whether your horse concept (prior to your move) meant the species or the wider class? It might be, if you are well read in biology, for instance, but suppose you are not. Then your concept — what "horse" actually means to you — would suffer the same indeterminacy as the frog's concept of fly (or was it all along the concept small airborne food item?).*

**I'm a little bit concerned about this being a bit of a language game. Misuse of a label. Although the thought experiment wouldn't change if the mechanism by which we'd label the horse wouldn't be done through language. Would the person feel that they'd been wrong if you told them the truth?

*This is an idea we have seen in an earlier incarnation, as the worry about minds' being mere effects, not originating causes. If meaning gets determined by the selective forces that endorse certain functional roles, then all meaning may seem, in a sense, to be only retrospectively attributed: what something means is not an intrinsic property it has, capable of making a difference in the world at the moment of its birth, but at best a retrospective coronation secured only by an analysis of the subsequent effects engendered. That is not quite right: an engineering analysis of the two-bitser, newly arrived in Panama, would permit us to say what roles the device, so configured, would be good for, even if it had not yet been chosen for any role. We could reach this verdict: its acceptance state could mean "quarter-balboa here now" if we put it in the right environment. But of course it could also mean lots of other things, if placed in other environments, so it won't mean any one of them until a particular functional role for it gets established — and there is no threshold for how long it takes a functional role to become established.*

**The wish that our minds are somehow above the world tends to mislead us in a lot of ways. It's the basis for some of our more narcissistic tendencies.

*Convinced by this line of reasoning, other philosophers began to argue that this showed that the properties red, green, and amber weren't really semantical or mentalistic properties after all, but only imitation semantical properties, mere as if semantical properties. What red and green were, really, were very, very complicated syntactical properties. These philosophers declined, however, to say anything further about just what syntactical properties these were, or to explain how even young children could swiftly and reliably produce instances of them, or recognize them. The philosophers were nevertheless convinced that there had to be a purely syntactic description of the regularity, since, after all, the causal systems in question were "just" computers, and computers are "just" syntactic engines, not capable of any real semanticity.*

**I'd like to hear Dennett on LLMs. This as if semantics, does it perhaps have depth and beyond a certain depth there's a phase transition? The semantics molecules stop looking like individual molecules and start looking like a semantics fluid? 

---
Page: 579

*The point of the fable is simple. There is no substitute for the intentional stance; either you adopt it, and explain the pattern by finding the semantic-level facts, or you will forever be baffled by the regularity — the causal regularity — that is manifestly there. The same moral, we have seen, can be drawn about interpreting the historical facts of evolutionary history. Even if you can describe, in matchless microdetail, every causal fact in the history of every giraffe who has ever lived, unless you go up a level or two and ask "Why?" — hunting for the reasons endorsed by Mother Nature — you will never be able to explain the manifest regularities, such as the fact that giraffes have come to have long necks, for instance.*

**What sense does our brain make of regularities of reality? Of nature, of things not designed? Is there anything in nature that doesn't contain design? How many regularities do we need to observe before our brain starts understanding it from a semantic, but pre-linguistic, level?

*This robot we have imagined will be richly engaged in its world and its projects, always driven ultimately by whatever remains of the goal states that you set up for it at the time you entered the capsule. All the preferences it will ever have will be the offspring of the preferences you initially endowed it with, in hopes that they would carry you into the twenty-fifth century, but that is no guarantee that actions taken in the light of the robot's descendant preferences will continue to be responsive, directly, to your  {425}  best interests. From your selfish point of view, that is what you hope, but this robot's projects are out of your direct control until you are awakened. It will have some internal representation of its currently highest goals, its summum bonum, but if it has fallen among persuasive companions of the sort we have imagined, the iron grip of the engineering that initially designed it will be jeopardized. It will still be an artifact, still acting only as its engineering permits it to act, but following a set of desiderata partly of its own devising.*

**Would it make a difference if we created a group of robots, each designed for agency but also to preserve the goal together?

Page: 586

*Then your selfish genes can be seen to be the original source of your intentionality — and hence of every meaning you can ever contemplate or conjure up — even though you can then transcend your genes, using your experience, and in particular the culture you imbibe, to build an almost entirely independent (or "transcendent") locus of meaning on the base your genes have provided.*

**At what point could we be considered to "transcend" our genes? How much of that transcendence is made available to us through our environment, our tools and our culture?

*In other words then, if a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be intelligent. There are several theorems which say almost exactly that. But these theorems say nothing about how much intelligence may be displayed if a machine makes no pretence at infallibility.*

**Is this a comment on the combinatorial explosion that would come from being perfectly logical?

---
Page: 592

*The Turing machines can each be given a unique identification number — its Library of Babel Number, if you like. Gödel's Theorem can then be reinterpreted to say that each of those Turing machines that happens to be a consistent algorithm for proving truths of arithmetic (and, not surprisingly, these are a Vast but Vanishing subset of all the possible Turing machines) has associated with it a Gödel sentence — a truth of arithmetic it cannot prove. So that is what Gödel, anchored by Turing to the world of computers, tells us: every computer that is a consistent truth-of-arithmetic-prover has an Achilles' heel, a truth it can never prove, even if it runs till doomsday. But so what?*

**What do all those other Turing machines do?

**One thing I've been wondering about, what does Godels theorem say about combining systems that are incompatible?  Are the truths that are not provable in one system, provable in another? What it seems to indicate is more the weakness of language, or at least symbolic language. 

**Does it have any implications for compression? 

---
Page: 601

*It should come as no surprise that the Vast majority of these bit strings do nothing at all worth mentioning if an attempt is made to "run" them as programs on the Toshiba. Programs, after all, are not random strings of bits, but highly designed sequences of bits, the products of thousands of hours of R and D. The fanciest program that ever could be is still something that can be expressed as one or another string of 0's and l's, and although my old Toshiba is too small to run some of the truly huge programs that have been devised, it is quite capable of running a handsome and representative subset of them: word-processors, spread sheets, chess-players, Artificial Life simulations, logic-proof-checkers, and, yes, even a few automatic arithmetic-truth-provers. Call any such runnable program, actual or envisaged, an interesting program (it is roughly analogous to a readable book, actual or imaginary, in the Library of Babel, or a viable genotype in the Library of Mendel). We don't have to worry about the boundary separating the interesting from the uninteresting; when in doubt, throw it out.*

**The vastness makes it a very bad idea to try to generate programs randomly. But the idea is still appealing to me for some reason. 

---
Page: 603

*Godel's Theorem in particular has nothing at all to tell us about whether there might be algorithms in the Library of Toshiba that could do an impressive job of "producing as true" or "detecting as true or false" candidate sentences of arithmetic. If human mathematicians can do an impressive job of "just seeing" with "mathematical intuition" that certain propositions are true, perhaps a computer can imitate this talent, the same way it can imitate chess-playing and conversation-holding: imperfectly, but impressively. That is exactly what people in AI believe: that there are risky, heuristic algorithms for human intelligence in general, just as there are for playing good checkers and good chess and a thousand other tasks. And here is where Penrose made his big mistake: he ignored this set of possible algorithms — the only set of algorithms that AI has ever concerned itself with — and concentrated on the set of algorithms that Godel's Theorem actually tells us something about.*

**The distinction between an algorithm and a heuristic would be good here. However I can see Dennett arguing for it just being another kind of algorithm, the important characteristics of it being mechanical and stupid still being true. 

---
Page: 605

*That is what organisms have done, every day since life began: they have bet their lives that the algorithms that built them, and that operate within them if they are among the lucky organisms with brains, will keep them alive long enough to have children. Mother Nature has never aspired to absolute certainty; a good risk is enough for her. So we would expect that, if mathematicians' brains are running algorithms, they will be algorithms that happen to do pretty well in the truth-detecting department, without being foolproof.*

**The risky flavor of our computation is what allows us to deal with combinatorial explosions.

---
Page: 606

*What kind of algorithms, then, might mathematicians be running? Algorithms "for" trying to stay alive. As we saw in our consideration of the survival-machine robots in the last chapter, such algorithms would have to  {441}  be capable of indefinitely resourceful discrimination and planning; they must be good at recognizing food and shelter, telling friend from foe, learning to discriminate harbingers of spring as harbingers of spring, telling good arguments from bad, and even — as a sort of bonus talent thrown in — recognizing mathematical truths as mathematical truths. Of course, such "Darwinian algorithms" (Cosmides and Tooby 1989) wouldn't have been designed just for this special purpose, any more than our eyes were designed for telling italics from boldface, but that doesn't mean that they aren't superbly sensitive to such differences if given a chance to consider them.*

**There seems to be a whole lot of trying to stay alive algorithms that don't lead to abilities exaptable for math. 

---
Page: 609

*It is not that mathematicians have fancier brains than the rest of us (or than chimpanzees) but that they have mind-tools — the social institutions in which mathematicians present each other their proofs, check each other out, make mistakes in public, and then count on the public to correct those mistakes. This does indeed give the mathematics community powers to discern mathematical truth that dwarf the powers of any individual human brain (even an individual brain with paper-and-pencil peripherals, a hand calculator, or a laptop!). But this does not show that human minds are not algorithmic devices; on the contrary, it shows how the cranes of culture can exploit human brains in distributed algorithmic processes that have no discernible limits.*

**Humanities true power is in our distributed cognition. Have anyone built proper social institutions for AI? Letting AI debate with other AI, etc.

*No program that is itself guaranteed to terminate can tell of every (finite) program whether or not it will terminate. But it might still be handy — worth some serious money — to have a program around that was very, very good (if not perfect) at this task. Another class of interesting problems are known as Diophantine Equations, and it is known that there is no algorithm guaranteed to solve all such equations. If our lives depended on it, should we spend a nickel on a program for solving Diophantine Equations "in general" or for checking for halting "in general"? (Remember: we shouldn't spend a nickel on perpetual-motion machines, even to save our lives, since it will be money wasted on an impossible task.)*

**Many things in our world are just approximations. You could never find a perfect circle in reality. Why is that?

*There are short novels nobody could write that would not just be bestsellers; they would be instantly recognized as classics. The keystrokes required to type them are all available on any word-processor, and the total number of keystrokes in any such book is trivial, but they still lie beyond the horizon of human creativity. Each particular creator, each novelist or composer or computer programmer, is sped along through Design Space by a particular idiosyncratic set of habits known as a style (Hofstadter 1985, sec. III). It is style that both constrains and enables us, giving a positive direction to our explorations but only by rendering otherwise neighboring regions off limits to us — and if off limits to us in particular, then probably off limits to everyone forever. Individual styles are truly unique, the product of untold billions of serendipitous encounters over the ages, encounters that produced first a unique genome, and then a unique upbringing, and finally a unique set of life experiences. Proust never got a chance to write any novels about the Vietnam War, and no one else could ever write them — the novels recounting that epoch in his manner. We are stuck, by our actuality and finitude, in a negligible corner of the total space of possibilities, but what a  {451}  fine actuality is still accessible to us, thanks to the R-and-D work of all our predecessors! We might as well make the most of what we have, thereby leaving rather more for our descendants to work with.*

**If you ever find yourself asking "what am I doing this for?", this paragraph is a good answer.

*To make the distinction vivid, we can imagine that a space pirate, Rumpelstiltskin by name, is holding the planet hostage, but will release us unharmed if we can answer a thousand true-false questions about sentences of arithmetic. Should we put a human mathematician on the witness stand, or a computer truth-checker devised by the best programmers? According to Penrose, if we hang our fate on the computer and let Rumpelstiltskin see the computer's program, he can devise an Achilles'-heel proposition that will foil our machine. (This would be true independendy of Godel's Theorem, if our program was a heuristic truth-checker, taking risks like any chess program.) But Penrose has given us no reason to believe that this isn't just as true of any human mathematicians we might put on the witness stand. None of us is perfect, and even a team of  {450}  experts no doubt has some weaknesses that Rumpelstiltskin could exploit, given enough information about their brains. Von Neumann and Morgenstern invented game theory to deal with the particular class of complicated problems that life throws at us when there are other agents around to compete with us. You are always wise to shield your brain from such competitors, whether you are a human being or a computer. The reason a competitive agent makes a difference in this instance is that the space of all mathematical truths is Vast, the space of Diophantine Equation solutions is a Vast but Vanishing subspace within it, and the odds of hitting upon a truth at random that would "break" or "beat" our machine is truly negligible, whereas an intelligent search through that space, guided by knowledge of the particular style of the opponent and its limitations, would be likely to find the needle in the haystack: a crushing countermove.*

**The computer would be at an unfair disadvantage. Let the pirate read the source code of the human's mind as well. 

**It's important to note that complex systems are built of simpler systems. Same is true for algorithms.

*How Hobbes would have admired Lynn Margulis' story of the eukaryotic revolution, and the creation, thereby, of multicellular life! Whereas before there had been nothing but boring prokaryotes, drifting through their nasty, brutish, short lives, now there could be multicellular organisms, which, thanks to a division of labor among a gang of specialist cells, could engage in Industry (oxygen-fired metabolism, in particular) and Arts (long-range perception and locomotion, and protective coloration, and so forth). And,  {455}  in due course, their descendants created multicellular societies of a very peculiar sort, known (until recently) as Men, capable of creating Letters (or representations), which they fell to exchanging promiscuously; this made possible a second revolution.*

*"They are Qualities, that relate to men in Society, not in Solitude." Hobbes called this epoch in our prehistory "the state of nature," because it resembled in its most important features the plight of all the other animals in the wild, to this day. In the state of nature, "there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; ... no Arts; no Letters, no Society; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short."*

*Multicellular organisms have solved the problem of group solidarity. One never hears tales of a person's thumbs rising up in civil war against the neighboring fingers, or of an eagle's wings going on strike, refusing to work unless some concession can be wrung from the beak or (more to the point) the gonads. And now that we have the genes-eye perspective from which to look at the world, this can strike us as something of a puzzle. Why don't these rebellions happen? Each cell in a multicellular organism has its own strings of DNA, a complete set of genes for making a whole organism, and if genes are selfish, why do the genes in the thumb cells or wing cells so docilely cooperate with the rest of the genes? Don't the DNA copies in the thumbs and wings count as genes? (Are they denied the vote? Why do they put up with it?)*

*But which "daughters" of your original zygote are destined for meiosis and which for mitosis? This, too, is a lottery. Thanks to this mindless mechanism, paternal and maternal genes (in you) could not ordinarily "know their fate" in advance. The question of whether they are going to have germ-line progeny that might have a flood of descendants flowing on into the future or be relegated to the sterile backwaters of somatic-line slavery for the good of the body politic or corporation (think of the etymology) is unknown and unknowable, so there is nothing to be gained by selfish competition among their "fellow" genes.*

*We, unlike the cells that compose us, are not on ballistic trajectories; we are guided missiles, capable of altering course at any point, abandoning goals, switching allegiances, forming cabals and then betraying them, and so forth. For us, it is always decision time, and because we live in a world of memes, no consideration is alien to us, or a foregone conclusion. For this reason, we are constantly faced with social opportunities and dilemmas of the sort for which game theory provides the playing field and the rules of engagement but not the solutions. Any theory of the birth of ethics is going to have to integrate culture with biology. As I have said before, life, for people in society, is more complicated.*

*Skyrms shows that when the individual elements of a group — whether of whole organisms or their parts — are closely related (clones or near-clones) or are otherwise able to engage in mutual recognition and assortative "mating," the simple game-theory model of the Prisoner's Dilemma, in which the strategy of defection always dominates, does not correctly model the circumstances. That is why our somatic cells don't defect; they are clones. This is one of the conditions under which groups — such as the group of my "host" cells — can have the "harmony and coordination" required to behave, quite stably, as an "organism" or "individual."*

**This reminds me a bit how the castes are organized in a beehive. In there, there are many individuals who are seemingly just slaves but they're OK with it since they're essentially protecting clones of themselves. Who's the mastermind? How does a process shape it all?

*Alternatively, since it was (in an extended sense) entirely natural — it wasn't supernatural — for us to step out of the state of nature and adopt a host of societal practices for our mutual benefit, we may simply deny that there is anything universally natural about the strong dominating  {462}  the weak, and the rest of the Social Darwinist nonsense. It is amusing to note that the fundamental (bad) argument of the Social Darwinists is identical to a (bad) argument used by many religious fundamentalists. Whereas the fundamentalists sometimes begin their arguments by saying, "If God had intended Man to ... [fly, wear clothes, drink alcohol,...]," the Social Darwinists begin theirs by saying, in effect, "If Mother Nature had intended Man to...," and even though Mother Nature (natural selection) can be viewed as having intentions, in the limited sense of having retrospectively endorsed features for one reason or another, these earlier endorsements may count for nothing now, since circumstances have changed.*

**Darwinian determinism is nonsense.

*The amazing and ingenious tale Nietzsche told about how the transvaluation of values happened defies fair summary, and is often outrageously misrepresented. I will not attempt to do justice to it here, but will just draw attention to its central theme (widiout judging its truth): the "aristocrats" who ruled by might over the weak were cunningly tricked (by the "priests") into adopting the inverted values, and this "slave revolt in morality" turned the cruelty of the strong against itself, so that the strong were manipulated into subduing and civilizing themselves.
For with the priests everything becomes more dangerous, not only cures and remedies, but also arrogance, revenge, acuteness, profligacy, love, lust to rule, virtue, disease — but it is only fair to add that it was on the soil of diis essentially dangerous form of human existence, the priesdy form, that man first became an interesting animal, that only here did the human soul in a higher sense acquire depth and become evil — and these are the two basic respects in which man has hitherto been superior to other beasts! [First Essay, sec. 6, p. 33.]*

**This reading of Nietzsche is interesting because it shows the whole slave morality story from a different light. And it's very interesting to see how memes can overthrow the current dictators. It's certainly happening at small scales all the time. MeToo was similar.

*Political correctness, in the extreme versions worthy of the name, is antithetical to almost all surprising advances in thought. We might call it eumemics, since it is, like the extreme eugenics of the Social Darwinists, an attempt to impose myopically derived standards of safety and goodness on the bounty of nature. Few today — but there are a few — would brand all genetic counseling, all genetic policies, with the condemnatory title of eugenics. We should reserve that term of criticism for the greedy and pereptory policies, the extremist policies. In chapter 18, we will consider how we might wisely patrol the memosphere, and what we might do to protect ourselves from the truly dangerous ideas, but we should keep the bad example of eugenics firmly in mind when we do so.)*

**Is anyone truly politically correct, even in the comfort of their own home? To me it seems so performative, but perhaps that gradually becomes normative as your outside self starts influencing your inside self. Cognitive dissonance and all that.

*Their error is sometimes called the "genetic fallacy" (e.g., Hoy 1986): the mistake of inferring current function or meaning from ancestral function or meaning. As Darwin (1862, p. 284) put it, "Thus throughout nature almost every part of each living thing has probably served, in a slightly modified condition, for diverse purposes, and has acted in the living machinery of many ancient and distinct specific forms." And as Nietzsche put it:
... the cause of the origin of a thing and its eventual utility, its actual employment and place in a system of purposes, lie worlds apart; whatever exists, having somehow come into being, is again and again reinterpreted to new ends, taken over, transformed, and redirected by some power superior to it; all events in the organic world are a subduing, a becoming master, and all subduing and becoming master involves a fresh interpretation, an adaptation through which any previous "meaning" and "purpose" are necessarily obscured or even obliterated. [Second Essay, sec. 12, P. 77.]
Aside from Nietzsche's characteristic huffing and puffing about some power subduing and becoming master, this is pure Darwin. Or, as Gould might put it, all adaptations are exaptations, in cultural evolution as well as in biological evolution.*

**Retroactive crowning, reinterpretation and exaptation. A good idea in one context may become a great idea in another context, or at least a stepping stone towards it.

*It is one thing to deny that collections of facts about the natural world are necessary to ground an ethical conclusion, and quite another to deny that any collection of such facts is sufficient. According to standard doctrine, if we stay firmly planted in the realm of facts about the world as it is, we will never find any collection of them, taken as axioms, from which any particular ethical conclusion can be conclusively proven. You can't get there from here, any more than you can get from any consistent set of axioms about arithmetic to all the true statements of arithmetic.
Well, so what? We may bring out the force of this rhetorical question with another one, rather more pointed: If "ought" cannot be derived from "is," just what can "ought" be derived from? Is ethics an entirely "autonomous" field of inquiry? Does it float, untethered to facts from any other discipline or tradition? Do our moral intuitions arise from some inexplicable ethics module implanted in our brains (or our "hearts," to speak with tradition)? that would be a dubious skyhook on which to hang our deepest convictions about what is right and wrong.*

**Something has always bothered me by the "is" "ought" divide. Clearly the ought should be based in some sort of reason and reason should be based on some sort of fact about the world.   Though ought lives on another level, it lives in some sense in the memesphere, however there are facts about cooperation and so on that should underpin it. 

---
Page: 644

*From what can "ought" be derived? The most compelling answer is this: ethics must be somehow based on an appreciation of human nature — on a sense of what a human being is or might be, and on what a human being might want to have or want to be. If that is naturalism, then naturalism is no fallacy. No one could seriously deny that ethics is responsive to such facts about human nature. We may just disagree about where to look for the most telling facts about human nature — in novels, in religious texts, in psychological experiments, in biological or anthropological investigations. The fallacy is not naturalism but, rather, any simple-minded attempt to rush from facts to values. In other words, the fallacy is greedy reductionism of values to facts, rather than reductionism considered more circumspectly, as the attempt to unify our world-view so that our ethical principles don't clash irrationally with the way the world is.*

**Greedy reductionism is bad, and it pulls down normal reductionism with it a lot of times.

*Even if Skinner were right (and surely he isn't) that a behaviorist regime is our best chance of preserving our culture into the future, I hope it is clear to you that Skinner may well have been mistaken when he deemed "survival of the culture" to be the highest goal any of us could ever imagine wanting to further. In chapter 11, we briefly considered how mad it would be to put survival of one's own genes ahead of everything else. Is survival of one's own culture a clearly saner item to put on the pedestal above everything else? Would it justify mass murder, for instance, or betraying all your friends? We meme-users can see other possibilities — beyond our genes, and beyond even the welfare of the groups (and cultures) to which we currently belong. Unlike our somatic-line cells, we can conceive of more complicated raisons d'etre.*

**We should appreciate the fact that we've gone beyond the genetic imperative, not come up with weird reasons for still binding ourselves to it. 

---
Page: 647

*Our reproductive ends may have been the ends that kept us in the running till we could develop culture, and they may still play a powerful — sometimes overpowering — role in our thinking, but that does not license any conclusion at all about our current values. It does not follow from the fact that our reproductive ends were the ultimate historical source of our present values, that they are the ultimate (and still principal) beneficiary of our ethical actions. If Ruse and Wilson think otherwise, they are committing the "genetic" fallacy Nietzsche (and Darwin) warned us about. As Nietzsche said, "the cause of the origin of a thing and its eventual utility, its actual employment and place in a system of purposes, lie worlds apart."*

**This paragraph made me think of ethical evolution. Why is that our morals seem to have improved? I would put it in the same camp as our technological evolution. Each new idea about how to live a good life gets tested, propagated, discarded, changed, and so on over time. From each new idea, other stepping stones are unlocked and the possibilities change.

*But all this means (unless it is just false) is that, in the long run, if we adopt cultural practices that have disastrous effects on the human gene pool, then  {471}  the human gene pool will succumb. There is no reason to think, however, that evolutionary biology shows us that our genes are powerful enough, and insightful enough, to keep us from making policies quite antithetical to their interests. On the contrary, evolutionary thinking shows us that our genes could hardly be smarter than the engineers who designed our imagined survival machines (see chapter 14), and look how helpless they were in the face of unanticipatable collaborations with other robots! We have seen examples of parasites — such as viruses — that manipulate the behavior of their hosts to further their interests instead of the hosts' own interests. And we have seen examples of commensals and mutualists that join to make common cause, creating a larger beneficiary out of parts. Persons, according to the meme model we have sketched, are just such larger, higher entities, and the policies they come to adopt, as a result of interactions between their meme-infested brains, are not at all bound to answer to the interests of their genes alone — or their memes alone. That is our transcendence, our capacity to "rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators," as Dawkins says, and there is nothing anti-Darwinian or antiscientific about it.*

**Are we as helpless to dictate what our society turns into? Are we the genes of society?

---
Page: 650

*Even if culture changes massively and continually across multiple generations, even if our problems and promises arise out of the cultural process of change, even if there are no genetic variations among humans that significantly affect their behavior, it is always true that the cumulative history of natural selection continues to influence our actions by the set of genes it has provided humanity.
This is indeed true, but it does not establish the point he thinks it does. As he insists, no matter how potent cultural forces are, they always have to act on the materials genetic forces have shaped for them, and will go on shaping, but they can just as readily redirect or exploit or subvert those genetically endorsed designs as attenuate or combat them. Sociobiologists, overreacting to the cultural absolutists (those crazy skyhookers) in much the way Darwin overreacted to the Catastrophists, like to emphasize that culture must have grown out of our biological inheritance. Indeed it must have, and it is also true that we grew from fish, but our reasons aren't the reasons of fish just because fish are our ancestors.*

**This exposes the genetic fallacy quite nicely. Just because something originated for a particular situation or reason does not mean that its reason in its current situation is the same. Adaptations and ideas are constantly reinterpreted.

*There are circumstances — extreme circumstances, as Wilson and Sober note — when we may reasonably curtail free thinking, but the Hutterites have to discourage free thinking all the time. They have to discourage reading whatever books you want, and listening to whomever you want. It is only by the most careful control of the communication channels that such a pristine state can be preserved. That is why the organismic solution is a nonsolution to the problems of human society. The Hutterites are thus themselves a curious example of greedy reductionism, not because they are individually greedy — they are apparently just the opposite — but because their solution to the problem of ethics is so drastically oversimplified. They are, however, an even better example of the power of memes to infect a group of mutual communicators in such a way that the whole group turns its efforts to ensuring the proliferation of those memes at whatever cost to themselves.*

**It's funny but sometimes the messiest structure is the most pristine. The planaria has a genome that's completely messed up, but it has strong error correcting mechanisms at the bioelectrics level instead. And indeed the planaria is in principle immortal, it's the most pristine living thing there is. Error correction beats perfection. 

---
Page: 652

*So the Hutterites are an example of how cultural evolution can create new group effects, and what is particularly delicious, from an evolutionist's point of view, is their method of fission:  {474} Like a honey bee colony, Hutterite brotherhoods split when they attain a large size, with one half remaining at the original site and the other half moving to a new site that has been preselected and prepared. In preparation for the split, the colony is divided into two groups that are equal with respect to number, age, sex, skills and personal compatibility. The entire colony packs its belongings and one of the lists is drawn by lottery on the day of the split. The similarity to the genetic rules of meiosis could hardly be more complete.*

**That's an extremely interesting way of scaling your group. Cut the locally situated tribe according to Dunnbar numbers and keep growing geographically while maintaining virtual connections between the parts.

*This is a branch of sociobiology or evolutionary ethics that no one should deride. It directly tests the hunches, such as those of Hobbes and Nietzsche, that there are natural, evolutionarily enforceable paths to where we are today. We may be quite sure that this is true, for here we are, but what this research promises to clarify is how much R-and-D work, of what sorts, was  {481}  required to get us here. At one extreme, it could turn out that there is an impressive bottleneck; a quite improbable but crucial series of happy accidents were required. (White's analysis offers some plausible reasons for believing that the conditions are really quite stringent.) At the other extreme it might turn out that there is a rather wide "basin of attraction" that will lead almost any cognitively sophisticated creatures, whatever their circumstances, into societies with recognizable ethical codes. It will be fascinating to see what large-scale computer simulations of these complex social interactions tell us about the constraints on the evolution of ethics. But we can already be virtually certain that mutual recognition and the capacity to communicate a promise — stressed by both Hobbes and Nietzsche — are necessary conditions for the evolution of morality.*

**It's very interesting to take an evolutionary approach to morals. Our ideas had to come from somewhere. What are our most advanced moral ideas based on? There's probably quite a long lineage of ideas in between those and the biological prerequisites. 

---
Page: 655

*Does that mean that religious texts are worthless as guides to ethics? Of course not. They are magnificent sources of insight into human nature, and into the possibilities of ethical codes. Just as we should not be surprised to discover that ancient folk medicine has a great deal to teach modern high-tech medicine, we should not be surprised if we find that these great religious texts hold versions of the very best ethical systems any human culture will ever devise. But, like folk medicine, we should test it all carefully, and take nothing whatever on faith. (Or do you think it is wise to pop those "holy" mushrooms in your mouth just because some millennias-old tradition declares they help you see the future?) The view I am expressing is what is often called "secular humanism."*

**Investigate and inquire, don't scorn and stop questioning. This is true for all phenomena in the world. We need error correction, not a "shut up" mentality.

*Now, once parental investment in their own offspring is secured for a species, how do we expand the circle (Singer 1981)? It is just as uncontroversial, thanks to Hamilton's pioneering work (1964) on "kin selection" and "inclusive fitness," that the same considerations that favor sacrifices for one's offspring also favor, to a mathematically precise degree, sacrifices for one's more distant relatives: offspring aiding parents, siblings helping each other, aunts helping nephews, and so forth. But, again, it is important to remember that the conditions under which such aid is evolutionarily enforceable are not only not universal but relatively rare.*

**Many things that have come to dominate started out relatively rare. I think it's very interesting to see a theoretical path of morality. 

---
Page: 667

*What does this mean? Gould is not saying, as he may seem at first to be saying, that adaptationist inference does not apply to humans. He is saying that since in the case of humans (and only humans) there is always another possible source of the adaptation in question — namely culture — one cannot so readily infer that there has been genetic evolution for the trait in question. Even in the case of nonhuman animals, the inference from adaptation to genetic basis is risky when the adaptation in question is not an anatomical feature but a behavioral pattern which is an obviously Good Trick. For then there is another possible explanation: the general nonstupidity of the species. As we have seen so often, the more obvious the move, the less secure the inference that it has to have been copied from predecessors — specifically carried by the genes.*

**The more we can leave to cultural evolution the more malleable we are. What is better to have genetically?

---
Page: 668

*The strategy is just too obvious. It felt like a forced move, but it was at least a Good Trick. We would not be surprised to find Martians backing themselves self-protectively into Martian caves, and the likelihood that Martians had morays for ancestors would presumably not be adjusted upwards from zero by the discovery. It is true that I am distantly related to moray eels, but the fact that I found this strategy in this environment is surely just a matter of its obvious excellence, given my needs and desires and my own assessment of my limitations at the time. This illustrates the fundamental obstacle — not insuperable, but much larger than is commonly acknowledged — to inference in human sociobiology: showing that a particular type of human behavior is ubiquitous or nearly ubiquitous in widely separated human cultures goes no way at all towards showing that there is a genetic predisposition for that particular behavior. So far as I know, in every culture known to anthropologists, the hunters throw their spears pointy-end-first, but this obviously doesn't establish that there is a pointy-end-first gene that approaches fixation in our species.*

**The notion of good and obvious tricks is a powerful one, it let's us realize what designs makes to originate from where. How would one visualize or mathematize good tricks in design space? Size, shine or perhaps redundancy?

---
Page: 669

*Nonhuman species can exhibit a similar, if reduced, capacity to reinvent the wheel, even though they lack culture. Octopuses are remarkably intelligent, and although they show no signs of cultural transmission, they are smart enough so that we should not be surprised to discover them individually hitting upon lots of Good Tricks that had never been posed as specific problems to their ancestors. Any such uniformity might be misread by  {487}  biologists as signs of a special "instinct," when in fact it was just their general intelligence that led them again and again to hit upon the same bright idea. The problem of interpretation for Homo sapiens is multiplied many times over by the fact of cultural transmission. Even if some individual hunters are not bright enough to figure out for themselves that they should throw the pointy end first, they will be told to do so by their peers, or will just notice their practice, and will appreciate the results immediately. In other words, if you are not totally idiotic, you don't need a genetic basis for any adaptation that you will pick up from your friends in any case.*

**How far would we go if cultural transmission was completely shut down? It's however far one individual would be able to go  in one lifetime. Is it possible to shutdown cultural transmission? You'd have to isolate each individual and hide all traces from each other. It's practically impossible, just by one other person or artifact around there'll be cultural transmission.

Page: 674

*Whereas animals are rigidly controlled by their biology, human behavior is largely determined by culture, a largely autonomous system of symbols and values, growing from a biological base, but growing indefinitely away from it. Able to overpower or escape biological constraints in most regards, cultures can vary from one another enough so that important portions of the variance are thereby explained... Learning is not a general-purpose process, but human beings have so many special-purpose gadgets, and learn to harness them with such versatility, that learning often can be treated as if it were an entirely medium-neutral and content-neutral gift of non-stupidity.
This is the model I have argued for in this book; it is no defense of skyhooks; it simply acknowledges that we now have cranes of more general power than the cranes of any other species.*

**The fact that accumulation turned on for us is what has created the large discrepancy between us and the animal kingdom. Then as for the large discrepancy in terms of consciousness and cognitive ability, it's the same thing. It's cultural transmission of thousands of thinking tools. If you took a human and threw it out into the jungle with barely anything, how intelligent would they become? 

---
Page: 682

*Just how practical is a system of ethical thinking supposed to be? What is an ethical theory for? Tacit differences of opinion about this issue, and even a measure of false consciousness among the protagonists, have added to the inconclusiveness of the subsequent debate.
For the most part, philosophers have been content to ignore the practical problems of real-time decision-making, regarding the brute fact that we are all finite and forgetful, and have to rush to judgment, as a real but irrelevant element of friction in the machinery whose blueprint they are describing. It is as if there might be two disciplines — ethics proper, which undertakes the task of calculating the principles determining what the ideal agent ought to do under all circumstances — and then the less interesting, "merely practical" discipline of Moral First Aid, or What to Do Until the Doctor of Philosophy Arrives, which tells, in rough and ready terms, how to make "online" decisions under time pressure.*

**We should be thinking of it from both angles. They will inform each other and we need both any way. If we could find a practical theory that has great efficacy that could greatly improve our justice system as well as work as a compass for every person. The practical everyday ethics is different from what we have in courts. They work with different problems. Should I help my relative out with x is very different from what should we do with y who murdered z?

---
Page: 687

*I do not at all intend this to be a shocking indictment, just a reminder of something quite obvious: no remotely compelling system of ethics has ever been made computationally tractable, even indirectly, for real-world moral problems. So, even though there has been no dearth of utilitarian (and Kantian, and contractarian, etc.) arguments in favor of particular policies, institutions, practices, and acts, these have all been heavily hedged with ceteris paribus clauses and plausibility claims about their idealizing assumptions. These hedges are designed to overcome the combinatorial explosion of calculation that threatens if one actually attempts — as theory says one must — to consider all things. And as arguments — not derivations — they have all been controversial (which is not to say that none of them could be sound in the last analysis).*

**Effective altruism I suppose suffers from the same flaw, though initially I guess the idea was to be empirical in their approach. 

---
Page: 691

*As we have seen again and again in this book, time-pressured decision-making is like that all the way down. Satisficing extends even back behind the fixed biological design of the decision-making agent, to the design "decisions" that Mother Nature settled for when designing us and other organisms. There may be somewhat nonarbitrary dividing lines to be drawn between biological, psychological, and cultural manifestations of this structure, but not only are the structures — and their powers and vulnerabilities — basically  {504}  the same; the particular contents of "deliberation" are probably not locked into any one level in the overall process but can migrate. Under suitable provocation, for instance, one can dredge up some virtually subliminal consideration and elevate it for self-conscious formulation and appreciation — it becomes an "intuition" — and then express it so that others can consider it as well. Moving in the other direction, a reason for action perennially mentioned and debated in committee can eventually "go without saying" — at least out loud — but continue to shape the thinking, both of the group and the individuals, from some more subliminal base (or bases) of operations in the process. As Donald Campbell (1975) and Richard Dawkins (1976, ch. 11) have argued, cultural institutions can sometimes be interpreted as compensations or corrections of the "decisions" made by natural selection.*

**How closely related is satisficing to relevance realization? 

---
Page: 689

*My example is meant to illustrate, enlarged and in slow motion, the ubiquitous features of real-time decision-making. First, there is the simple physical impossibility of "considering all things" in the allotted time. Note that "all things" doesn't have to mean everything or even everybody in the world, but just everything in 250,000 readily available dossiers. You have all the information you need "at your fingertips"; there need be no talk of conducting further investigations. Second, there is the ruthless and peremptory use of some distinctly second-rate cut rules. No one thinks Grade Point Average is a remotely foolproof indicator of promise, though it is probably somewhat superior to weight of dossier, and clearly superior to number of letters in surname. There is something of a trade-off between ease of application and reliability, and if no one can quickly think of any easily applied criteria that one can have some faith in, it would be better to eliminate step (1) and proceed straight to the lottery for all candidates. Third, the lottery illustrates a partial abdication of control, giving up on a part of the task and letting something else — nature or chance — take over for a while, yet still assuming responsibility for the result. (That is the scary part.) Fourth, there is the phase where you try to salvage something presentable from the output of that wild process; having oversimplified your task, you count on a meta-level process of self-monitoring to correct or renormalize or improve your final product to some degree. Fifth, there is the endless vulnerability to second-guessing and hindsight wisdom about what you should have done — but done is done. You let the result stand, and go on to other things. Life is short.*

**A couple of things that are missing from this discussion, one is that accumulated experience over time gives us time to make better and better decisions. Yes we'll be under time pressure for every new situation but after the first time we'll have time to deliberate for the second go. Two is technology, it'll render moot some of the problems that have previously been limited by computation or scale.

Page: 700

*That is the easy problem, a conveniently delimited, already well-framed local decision. The hard problem is: how do we get there from here? How can we justifiably find a route from our actual predicament to that relatively happy and straightforwardly decidable predicament? Our prior problem, it seems, is that every day, while trying desperately to mind our own business, we hear a thousand cries for help, complete with volumes of information on how we might oblige. How on Earth could anyone prioritize that cacophony? Not by any systematic process of considering all things, weighing expected utilities, and attempting to maximize. Nor by any systematic generation and testing of Kantian maxims — there are too many to consider.  {510} 
Yet we do get there from here. Few of us are paralyzed by such indecision for long stretches of times. By and large, we must solve this decision problem by permitting an utterly "indefensible" set of defaults to shield our attention from all but our current projects. Disruptions of those defaults can only occur by a process that is bound to be helter-skelter heuristics, with arbitrary and unexamined conversation-stoppers bearing most of the weight.
That arena of competition encourages escalations, of course. With our strictly limited capacity for attention, the problem faced by others who want us to consider their favorite consideration is essentially a problem of advertising — of attracting the attention of the well-intentioned. This competition between memes is the same problem whether we view it in the wide-scale arena of politics or in the close-up arena of personal deliberation. The role of the traditional formulae of ethical discussion as directors of attention, or shapers of habits of moral imagination, as meta-memes par excellence, is thus a subject deserving further scrutiny.*

**How does our salience landscaping work? What does our set of defaults mean? How can they be shaped? How have they been shaped up to now?

*Obviously, you do not push the button, right? But what if just one person were a little bit overcautious or dubious, and began wondering whether this was obvious after all? Everyone should allow that this is an outside chance, and everyone should recognize that everyone should allow this. As Hofstadter notes (p. 753), it is a situation "in which the tiniest flicker of a doubt has become amplified into the gravest avalanche of doubt.... And one of the annoying things about it is that the brighter you are, the more quickly and clearly you see what there is to fear. A bunch of amiable slowpokes might well be more likely to unanimously refrain and get the big payoff than a bunch of razor-sharp logicians who all think perversely recursively rever-berantly."*

**It's interesting to hear that the more logical you are the more susceptible you are to reverberant doubt. How does one find the most appropriate level of rationality given the situation? That must be what wisdom is, but what does it consist of?

*We correctly intuit a kinship between the finest productions of art and science and the glories of the biosphere. William Paley was right about one thing: our need to explain how it can be that the universe contains many wonderful designed things. Darwin's dangerous idea is that they all exist as fruits of a single tree, the Tree of Life, and the processes that have produced each and every one of them are, at bottom, the same. The genius exhibited by Mother Nature can be disassembled into many acts of micro-genius — myopic or blind, purposeless but capable of the most minimal sort of recognition of a good (a better) thing. The genius of Bach can likewise be  {512}  disassembled into many acts of micro-genius, tiny mechanical transitions between brain states, generating and testing, discarding and revising, and testing again.*

*I began this book with a song which I myself cherish, and hope will survive "forever." I hope my grandson learns it and passes it on to his grandson, but at the same time I do not myself believe, and do not really want my grandson to believe, the doctrines that are so movingly expressed in that song. They are too simple. They are, in a word, wrong — just as wrong as the ancient Greeks' doctrines about the gods and goddesses on Mount Olympus. Do you believe, literally, in an anthropomorphic God? If not, then you must agree with me that the song is a beautiful, comforting falsehood. Is that simple song nevertheless a valuable meme? I certainly think it is. It is a modest but beautiful part of our heritage, a treasure to be preserved. But we must face the fact that, just as there were times when tigers would not have been viable, times are coming when they will no longer be viable, except in zoos and other preserves, and the same is true of many of the treasures in our cultural heritage.*

**The efficacy of designs in design space is a dynamic property. As other designs are found and as the environment changes, some designs fall out of favor.

Page: 705

*These questions don't have obvious and uncontroversial answers, so the Design Space perspective certainly doesn't explain everything about value, but at least it lets us see what happens when we try to unify our sense of value in a single perspective. On the one hand, it helps to explain our intuition that uniqueness or individuality is "intrinsically" valuable. On the other hand, it lets us confirm all the incommensurabilities that people talk about.*

**Value is unfortunately quite contextual. I guess we should be happy when there's widespread consensus about the value of something.
