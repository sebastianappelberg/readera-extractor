*creating value starts with putting the talent you have to its best and highest use.*

*T eaming is the art of communicating and coordinating with people across boundaries of all kinds – expertise, status, and distance, to name the most important.*

Page: 21

*In an era when no individual can know or do everything needed to carry out the work that serves customers, it’s more important than ever for people to speak up, share information, contribute expertise, Introduction xxi take risks, and work with each other to create lasting value. Y et, as Edmund Burke wrote more than 250 years ago, fear limits our abil-ity for ef f ective thought and action – even for the most talented of employees. T oday’s leaders must be willing to take on the job of driv-ing fear out of the organization to create the conditions for learning, innovation, and growth.*

*Christina stepped forward to remind Dr. Drake about the surfactant and then caught herself. Last week she’d overheard him publicly berate another nurse for questioning one of his orders. She told herself that the twins would probably be f i ne – after all, the doctor probably had a reason for avoiding the surfactant, still considered a judgment call – and she dismissed the idea of bringing it up.*


---
Page: 27

*Inadvertently, she had done something psychologists call discounting the future – underweighting the more important issue of the patients’ health, which would take some time to play out, and overweighting the importance of the doctor’s possible response, which would happen immediately.*

*no one wakes up in the morning excited to go to work and look ignorant, incompetent, or disruptive. These are called interpersonal risks, and they are what nearly everyone seeks to avoid, not always consciously.*


---
Page: 29

*Remaining silent due to fear of interpersonal risk can make the dif f erence between life and death. Airplanes have crashed, f i nancial institutions have fallen, and hospital patients have died unnecessarily because individuals were, for reasons having to do with the climate in which they worked, afraid to speak up.*


---
Page: 30

*The free exchange of ideas, concerns or questions is routinely hindered by interpersonal fear far more often than most managers realize. This kind of fear cannot be directly seen. Silence – when voice was possible – rarely announces 8 The Power of Psychological Safety itself! The moment passes, and no one is the wiser except the person who held back.*


---
Page: 30

*Valuable forms of speaking up include raising a dif f erent point of view in a conference call, asking a colleague for feedback on a report, admitting that a project is over budget or behind schedule, and so on*


---
Page: 31

*psychological safety as the belief that the work environment is safe for interpersonal risk taking.*


---
Page: 31

*psychological safety emerges as a property of a group, and that groups in organi-zations tend to have very interpersonal climates. Even in a company with a strong corporate culture, you will f i nd pockets of both high and low psychological safety.*


---
Page: 33

*But why else might better teams have higher error rates?
And then came the eureka moment. What if the better teams had a climate of openness that made it easier to report and discuss error?
The good teams, I suddenly thought, don’t make more mistakes; they report more.*


---
Page: 34

*psychological safety seems to “live” at the level of the group.*


---
Page: 35

*Schein later noted that psychological safety was vital for helping people overcome the defensiveness and “learning anxiety” they face at work, especially when something doesn’t go as they’d hoped or expected.10 Psychological safety, he argued, allows people to focus on achieving shared goals rather than on self-protection.*


---
Page: 36

*What was clear was that leaders in some groups had been able to ef f ectively create the conditions for psychological safety while other leaders had not.*


---
Page: 37

*Fear inhibits learning. Research in neuroscience shows that fear consumes physiologic resources, diverting them from parts of the brain that manage working memory and process new information.
This impairs analytic thinking, creative insight, and problem solv-ing.15This is why it’s hard for people to do their best work when they are afraid. As a result, how psychologically safe a person feels strongly shapes the propensity to engage in learning behaviors, such as information sharing, asking for help, or experimenting. It also af f ects employee satisfaction.*


---
Page: 39

*Nice, in short, is not synonymous with psychologically safe. In a related vein, psychological safety does not imply ease or comfort. In contrast, psychological safety is about candor and willingness to engage in productive conf l ict so as to learn from dif f erent points of view.*


---
Page: 39

*However, research shows that the experience of psychological safety at work is not correlated with introversion and extroversion.17This is because psychological safety refers to the work climate, and climate af f ects people with dif f erent personality traits in roughly similar ways. In a psychologically safe climate, people will of f er ideas and voice their concerns regardless of whether they tend toward introversion or extroversion.*


---
Page: 40

*One way to put this is that trust is about giving others the benef i t of the doubt, and psychological safety relates to whether others will give you the benef i t of the doubt when, for instance, you have asked for help or admitted a mistake.*


---
Page: 40

*Psychological Safety Is Not About Lowering Performance Standards*


---
Page: 42

*High standards in a context where there is uncertainty or interdependence (or both) combined with a lack of psychological safety comprise a recipe for suboptimal performance.*


---
Page: 44

*I do not mean to imply that psychological safety is all you need for high performance. Not even close. I like to say that psychological safety takes of f the brakes that keep people from achieving what’s possible.*


---
Page: 49

*In any company confronting conditions that might be characterized as volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), psy-chological safety is directly tied to the bottom line.*


---
Page: 53

*people often hold back even when they believe that what they have to say could be important for the organization, for the customer, or for themselves.*


---
Page: 54

*the two most frequently mentioned reasons for remaining silent were one, fear of being viewed or labeled neg-atively, and two, fear of damaging work relationships.*

*he was admit-ting that his reticence to rock the boat with what he believed was a good idea was irrational, and deep down he understood that. Y et the gravitational pull of silence – even when bosses are well-meaning and don’t think of themselves as intimidating – can be overwhelming.*


---
Page: 57

*the asymmetry of voice and silence.*


---
Page: 57

*We can be completely conf i dent that we’ll be safe if we are silent, and we lack conf i dence that our voices will really make a dif f erence – a voice inhibiting combination.*

**What about creating repercussions for being silent?

---
Page: 58

*What if the current system is ef f ectively the boss’s baby? By suggesting a change, we might be calling the boss’s baby ugly. Better to stay silent.*

**Makes me think of the team positions concept.

---
Page: 59

*psycho-logically safe teams made fewer errors and spoke up about them more often.*


---
Page: 60

*The problems that trigger workarounds can be seen as small signals of*


---
Page: 61

*a need for change in a system or process.*


---
Page: 61

*psychological safety makes it easier for people to speak up about problems and to alter and improve work processes rather than engaging in the counterproductive workarounds.*


---
Page: 61

*imagine you’re at work and you’ve got an idea you’re 95% conf i dent is creative or interesting. Y ou’ll probably have no trouble speaking up. Now imagine that same sit-uation but you’re only 40% conf i dent of your idea. Most people will hesitate*


---
Page: 62

*Communication frequency among coworkers also led to psychological safety. In other words, the more we talk to each other, the more comfortable we become doing so.*

**We've seen this first-hand. As we started doing more meetings the maturity of the teams started to accelerate. 

---
Page: 64

*four other factors that helped explain team performance – clear goals, dependable colleagues, personally meaningful work, and a belief that the work has impact. As Rozovsky put it, however, reiterating the quote at the start of Chapter 1, “psychological safety was by far the most important . . . it was the underpinning of the other four.”*

*Disengaged employees lead to safety risks and to staf f turnover. Turnover means higher recruiting and training costs, as well as a higher percentage of less experienced workers on staf f .*

Page: 67

*people are not always good at navigating conf l ict and putting it to good use.36It’s easy to get upset or dig in one’s heels, ef f ec-tively squandering the opportunity to improve the work by working through dif f erences.*


---
Page: 80

*What many people do not realize is that motivation by fear is indeed highly ef f ective – ef f ective at creating the illusion that goals are being achieved. It is not ef f ective in ensuring that people bring the creativity, good process, and passion needed to accomplish challenging goals in knowledge-intensive workplaces.*


---
Page: 79

*many organizational leaders gen-uinely believe that “no news” means that things are going well. They assume that if people were struggling to implement some directive or another, they would speak up and push back. They take for granted that their own voices are welcome and fail to appreciate that others might feel unable to bring bad news up the chain of command.*


---
Page: 83

*unreachable target goals, a command-and-control hierarchy that motivates by fear, and people afraid to lose their jobs if they fail – has been repeated again and again. In part that’s because it’s a script that was useful in the past, when goals were reachable, progress directly observable, and tasks largely individually executed. Under those conditions, people could be compelled to reach them simply by fear and intimidation. The problem is that, in today’s volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambigu-ous (VUCA) world, this is no longer a script that’s good for business.
Rather than success, it’s a playbook that invites avoidable, and often painfully public, failure.*


---
Page: 86

*Wells Fargo’s avoidable failure was not the result of one bad apple but of a system that demanded hitting targets so ambitious they could only be met by deceit. Employees operated in a culture of fear that brooked no dissent. Rather than manifesting interest in salespeople’s experiences while executing the cross-selling strategy and using what was being learned in the f i eld to shift or sharpen the company’s strategy,40 managers sent a clear message:
produce – or else.*


---
Page: 92

*What started as small gaps in execution spiraled into dramatic, headline-making failures when new information created by actual experience – whether of engineers or salespeople – was not captured and put to good use in rethinking and redirecting company ef f orts.*


---
Page: 94

*Orga-nizational learning – championed by company leaders but enacted by everyone – requires actively seeking deviations that challenge the assumptions underpinning a current strategy. Then, of course, these deviations must be welcomed because of their informative value for adapting the original strategy. Ironically, pushing harder on “exe-cution” in response to early signals of underperformance may only aggravate the problem if shortcomings reveal that prior market intel-ligence or assumptions about the business model were f l awed.*

**Decentralization.

---
Page: 94

*Early information about shortcomings can nearly always miti-gate the size and impact of future, large-scale failure.*

**Relating this with Flow, it's all about shortening feedback cycles.

---
Page: 102

*many people report a similar experience of feeling unable to speak up when hierarchy is made salient. Mean-while, the higher ups in a position to listen and learn are often blind to the silencing ef f ects of their presence.*

**I've felt this from my employees many times. How does one fix it? Is the only option to not be present?

---
Page: 105

*Exhorting people to speak up because it’s the right thing to do relies on an ethical argument but is not a strategy for ensuring good outcomes. Insisting on acts of courage puts the onus on individuals without creating the conditions where the expectation is likely to be met.
For speaking up to become routine, psychological safety – and expectations about speaking up – must become institutionalized and systematized.*

**I have tendency to want to tell people how they should behave. It's not very effective.

---
Page: 106

*A direct line of command, where everyone knows his or her place, has its benef i ts. However, deference to others, especially in the face of ambiguity, can become the default mode of operation, leading everyone to believe that the person-on-top always knows best. In some cases, an implicit belief that the person with the highest place on the hierarchy must also be the authority can lead to fatal consequences.*


---
Page: 109

*Raising concerns that turn out to be unfounded presents a learning opportunity for the person speaking up and for those listening who thereby glean crucial information about what others understand or don’t understand about the situation or the task.*


---
Page: 109

*A culture of silence is thus not only one that inhibits speaking up but one in which people fail to listen thoughtfully to those who do speak up – especially when they are bringing unpleasant news.*


---
Page: 114

*A culture of silence can thus be understood as a culture in which the prevailing winds favor going along rather than of f ering one’s concerns. It is based on the assumption that most people’s voices do not of f er value and thus will not be valued.*


---
Page: 114

*For all the extensive detail it provides, what this report cannot fully convey – especially to a global audience – is the mindset that supported the negligence behind this disaster. What must be admitted – very painfully – is that this was a disaster “Made in Japan.” Its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our ref l exive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to “sticking with the program”; our groupism; and our insularity.*


---
Page: 129

*When people feel psychologically safe enough to contribute insight, opinion, or suggestion, the knowledge in the room thereby increases exponentially. This is because individual observations and suggestions build on each other, taking new shape and creating new value, especially compared to what happens when individual feedback is collected separately.*


---
Page: 129

*Pixar’s Braintrust has rules. First, feedback must be construc-tive – and about the project, not the person. Similarly, the f i lmmaker cannot be defensive or take criticism personally and must be ready to hear the truth. Second, the comments are suggestions, not prescriptions. There are no mandates, top-down or otherwise; the director is ultimately the one responsible for the movie and can take or leave solutions of f ered. Third, candid feedback is not a “gotcha” but must come from a place of empathy.*


---
Page: 131

*Catmull believes that without the freedom to fail people “will seek instead to repeat something safe that’s been good enough in the past. Their work will be derivative, not innovative.”11As in so many other contexts, experimentation and its inevitable trial-and-error process are necessary to innovation.*


---
Page: 131

*We need to understand failure not as something to fear or try to avoid, but as a natural part of learning and exploration. Just as learning to ride a bike entails the physical discomfort of skinned knees or bruised elbows, creating a stunningly original movie requires the psychological pain of failure. Moreover, trying to avoid the pain of failure in learning will lead to far worse pain. Catmull: “for lead-ers especially, this strategy – trying to avoid failure by outthinking it – dooms you to fail.”*

*In framing silence as an unethical choice, Dalio is taking a more extreme stance than I have adopted. But it’s worth ref l ecting on this idea, which to me implies that you owe your colleagues the expression of your opinion or ideas; in a sense, those ideas belong to the collective enterprise, and you therefore don’t have the right to hoard them.*


---
Page: 133

*Candid feedback at Bridgewater is thus constant and detailed.
Every employee is required to keep an Issue Log, which records individual mistakes, strengths and weaknesses, and a “pain button,” which records the employee’s reaction to specif i c criticisms as well as their changes in behavior to remedy weaknesses, and whether those changes were ef f ective.*


---
Page: 134

*He believes that “our society’s ‘mis-takephobia’ is crippling”21because, beginning in elementary school, we are taught to seek the right answer instead of learning to learn from mistakes as a pathway to innovative and independent thinking.
Early on, he says he “learned that everyone makes mistakes and has weaknesses and that one of the most important things that dif f eren-tiates people is their approach to handling them.” For that reason, at Bridgewater, “it is okay to makes mistakes, but unacceptable not to identify, analyze, and learn from them.”*


---
Page: 134

*“don’t try to ‘win’ the argument. Finding out that you are wrong is even more valuable than being right, because you are learning.”24It’s important to know when to move on from a disagreement and not spend too much time on trivial details.*

**Productive conflict is very similar to creative abrasion from Collective Genius.

Page: 135

*While the boundaries between debate, discussion, and teaching may often be f l uid in a fearless organization – communications may combine all three categories – these three categories of f er useful ways of thinking about and structuring how to speak to one another in a psychologically safe environment.*

*Fisher calls herself a natural listener, which helps to make “not know-ing” a positive trait. When f i rst setting up her company, she found the combination of these two traits to be an advantage. As she says, “when you don’t know and you’re really listening intently, people want to help you. They want to share.”32Evidently, she’s managed to maintain the vulnerability and receptivity of her original “I don’t know,” even as she’s become a seasoned leader of an enduring brand in the fashion industry. One of the outcomes of managing by not knowing is, as Fisher says, that “people feel safe to explore their own ideas instead of feeling like they just need to do what you tell them to do.”*

*“saying yes gives people permission” to go forward.*

**People want to be engaged but they're not always sure if it's their place, if they're overstepping. 

---
Page: 141

*It’s natural to worry what other people will think and about losing our job. That’s why, unless a leader expressly and actively makes it psychologically safe to do so, people will seek to avoid failure.*


---
Page: 141

*Just as vital as creating a psychologically safe environment for smart failure is constructing a specif i c process for handling failure.*


---

*f i rst runs a pre-mortem, trying to come up with as many reasons as possible why the idea could fail.50“Rapid Eval,” as the team is known, considers the problem’s scale, feasibility, and technological risks. During this iterative stage, issues are questioned, changed, and ref i ned by engaging in candid conversation that’s not unlike Pixar’s Braintrust.*


---
Page: 142

*If Rapid Eval is convinced by the prototype, it runs the idea by a second busi-ness group called “Foundry,” which asks, “Should this solution exist?
Is there a business case to be made for the proposed solution? If we can build it, will people actually use it?”*

*Following his principle that in a caring family “all the family members would absorb some pain so that no mem-ber of the family had to experience a dramatic loss,”59there were no layof f s. Instead, all employees, no matter their position, took a manda-tory unpaid furlough of four weeks at the time of their choosing.*

*Chapman traveled to various units and sat down with small groups of people to listen to their feelings about the Principles. He learned that trust – employees feeling trusted by management – was key, and that time clocks, break bells, and locking inventory in cages inhibited that trust. Chapman describes immediately getting rid of what he calls “trust-destroying and demeaning practices”62inappropriate for responsible adults. Listening sessions, as they are called, have since become institutionalized times where team members are asked to speak their minds.*


---
Page: 147

*Leaders who are willing to say “I don’t know” play a sur-prisingly powerful role in engaging the hearts and minds of employees.*


---
Page: 156

*Psychological safety does not imply excessive talking and over-processing. Psychologically safe meetings do not have to take longer. Conversely, I’ve studied management team meetings where low psychological safety gave rise to indirectness of argument that consumed far more time than necessary. Worse, key decisions were often postponed due to evident conf l ict that was not ef f ectively discussed, making the discussions and the total decision time (in months) take far more time than necessary.*


---
Page: 165

*A leader can be the driving force and catalyst for others to speak up; but ultimately, the practice must be co-created – and continuously nurtured – by multiple stakeholders.*


---
Page: 167

*Concerned that fear might interfere with workers’ ability to remember his instructions, he made the groups repeat the instructions back to him before they left. The point was not to command action but to assist them in acting quickly should the situation change, and their safety be compromised.*


---
Page: 168

*Masuda’s strength as a leader was demonstrated by the immedi-ate admission of his mistake. In keeping with Ray Dalio’s Principles, Masuda succeeded by virtue of extreme candor – by telling people the worst news, which he believed would increase the chances they could f i gure out how to handle the situation. Despite its unwelcome nature, the admission increased the psychological safety in the team and bonded the group more tightly.*


---
Page: 169

*Masuda inf l uenced the workers to act, even as the ground shook beneath their feet. Through his calmness, openness, and willingness to admit his own fallibility as a leader, Masuda created the conditions for the team to make sense of their surroundings, overcome fear, and solve problems on the f l y. Although their physical safety was in constant danger, they felt psychologically safe, and this allowed them to come together, try things, fail, and regroup. In the many moments of fear for their lives over the course of those days, interpersonal fear within the group was nearly nil. Masuda’s words and actions set the tone and reassured workers that they could – and must – save the plant.*


---
Page: 166

*Instead of grabbing a megaphone or commanding his men into action, Masuda began writing things down on a whiteboard: the mag-nitude and frequency of the earthquake’s aftershocks, calculations, and a rough chart that demonstrated the decreasing danger of the quakes over time. In other words, he armed his men with data.*

Page: 181

*Whenever you are trying to get people on the same page, with com-mon goals and a shared appreciation for what they’re up against, you’re setting the stage for psychological safety. The most important skill to master is that of framing the work. If near-perfection is what is needed to satisfy demanding car customers, leaders must know to frame the work by alerting workers to catch and correct tiny deviations before the car proceeds down the assembly line. If zero worker fatalities in a dangerous platinum mine is the goal, then leaders must frame physical safety as a worthy and challenging but attainable goal. If discovering new cures is the goal, leaders know to motivate researchers to generate smart hypotheses for experiments and to feel okay about being wrong far more often than right. In this section, I’ll f i rst explaining how and why framing the work in*


---
Page: 184

*Note that failure plays a varying role in dif f erent kinds of work.*

**Celebrating failure means different things depending on the context. Find a way to frame it in a way that promotes desired behavior and becomes a part of the learning process. 

---
Page: 183

*In other words, unless a leader expressly and actively makes it psychologically safe to do so, people will auto-matically seek to avoid failure. So how did T eller reframe failure to make it okay? By saying, believing, and convincing others that “I’m not pro failure, I’m pro learning.”*


---
Page: 185

*An important part of framing is making sure peo-ple understand that failures will happen. Some failures are genuinely good news; some are not, but no matter what type they are, our primary goal is to learn from them.*


---
Page: 185

*Framing the work also involves calling attention to other ways, beyond failure’s prevalence, in which tasks and environments dif f er.
Three especially important dimensions are uncertainty, interde-pendence, and what’s at stake – all of which also have implications for failure (e.g. expectations about its frequency, its value, and its consequences).*


---
Page: 189

*Framing the work is not something that leaders do once, and then it’s done. Framing is ongoing. Frequently calling attention to levels of uncertainty or interdependence helps people remember that they must be alert and candid to perform well.*


---
Page: 189

*Emphasizing a sense of purpose is another key element of setting the stage for psychological safety. Motivating people by articulating a compelling purpose is a well-established leadership task. Leaders who remind people of why what they do matters – for customers, for the world – help create the energy that carries them through challenging moments.*


---
Page: 189

*It’s the leader’s job to bring people back to a psychological place where they are in touch with how much their work matters. This also helps the overcome the interpersonal risks they face at work.*


---
Page: 192

*In sum, leaders who are approachable and accessible, acknowledge their fallibility, and proactively invite input from others can do much to establish and enhance psychological safety in their organizations.*

*Attributes of a Powerful Question26 ◾ Generates curiosity in the listener ◾ Stimulates ref l ective conversation ◾ Is thought-provoking ◾ Surfaces underlying assumptions ◾ Invites creativity and new possibilities ◾ Generates energy and forward movement ◾ Channels attention and focuses inquiry ◾ Stays with participants ◾ T ouches a deep meaning ◾ Evokes more questions*


---
Page: 193

*The foundational skill lies in cultivating genuine interest in others’ responses. Why is this hard? Because all adults, especially high-achieving ones, are subject to a cognitive bias called naive realism that gives us the experience of “knowing” what’s going on.25As noted in the previous section, we believe we are seeing “reality” – rather than a subjective view of reality. As a result, we often fail to wonder what others are seeing. We fail to be curious. Worse, many leaders, even when they are motivated to ask a question, worry that it will make them look uninformed or weak.*


---
Page: 195

*A third way to invite participation and reinforce psychological safety is to implement structures designed to elicit employee input.*


---
Page: 196

*T o reinforce a climate of psychological safety, it’s imperative that leaders – at all levels – respond productively to the risks people take. Productive responses are characterized by three elements:
expressions of appreciation, destigmatizing failure, and sanctioning clear violations.*


---
Page: 196

*whether the doctor believes the nurse’s suggestion or question is good or bad. Either way, his initial response must be one of appreci-ation. Then he can educate – that is, give feedback or explain clinical subtleties.*


---
Page: 197

*Productive responses often include expressions of appreciation, ranging from the small (“thank you so much for speaking up”) to the elaborate – celebrations or bonuses in response to intelligent failure.*


---
Page: 197

*Praising ef f ort is especially important in uncertain environments, where good outcomes are not always the result of good process, and vice versa.*


---
Page: 198

*Leaders who respond to all failures in the same way will not create a healthy environment for learning. When a failure occurs because someone violated a rule or value that matters in the organization, this is very dif f erent than when a thoughtful hypothesis in the lab turns out to be wrong.*


---
Page: 200

*In brief, a productive response to preventable failures is to double down on prevention, usually a combination of training and improved system design to make it easier for people to do the right thing. How-ever, there are instances in which a preventable failure is the result of a blameworthy action or a repeated instance of deviation from pre-scribed process, impervious to prior attempts at redirection. In such cases, usually rare, there is an obligation to act in ways that prevent future occurrence. This may mean f i nes or other sanctions, and in some cases even f i ring someone.*


---
Page: 201

*Y es, f i ring can sometimes be an appropriate and productive response – to a blameworthy act. But won’t this kill the psychological safety?
No. Most people are thoughtful enough to recognize (and appreci-ate) that when people violate rules or repeatedly take risky shortcuts, they are putting themselves, their colleagues, and their organization at risk. In short, psychological safety is reinforced rather than harmed by fair, thoughtful responses to potentially dangerous, harmful, or sloppy behavior.*


---
Page: 202

*a productive response is concerned with future impact.
Punishment sends a powerful message, and an appropriate one if boundaries were clear in advance. Indeed, it is vital to send messages that reinforce values the company holds dear. However, it is equally vital not to inadvertently send a message that says, “diverse opinions 180 Creating a Fearless Organization simply won’t be tolerated here,” or “one strike and you’re out.”
Such messages reduce psychological safety and ultimately erode the quality of the work.*


---
Page: 210

*In any company that thrives in our complex and uncertain world, leaders must be lis-tening intently, with a deep understanding that people are both the sensors who pick up signals that change is necessary and the source of creative new ideas to test and implement.*


---
Page: 219

*No. I don’t think you can have too much psychological safety. I do think, however, that you can have not enough discipline. Psychological safety is about reducing interpersonal fear. Making it less heroic to ask a question or admit an error.
It doesn’t mean you automatically have a good strategy for getting the work done. It also doesn’t mean your employees are suf f i ciently motivated or well-trained.*


---
Page: 220

*Although not a hard and fast rule, psychological safety can be a source of ef f i ciency. For instance, I’ve studied senior management teams in which a lack of psychological safety contributed to long-winded conversations (indirect statements, with veiled criticisms and personal innuendo, take longer than can-did ones), elongated meetings, and an inability to come to a resolu-tion about crucial strategic issues.*


---
Page: 222

*Saying things to frame the challenge you see ahead is another helpful practice. Reminding people of what the team is up against – for example, by talking about how the work is uncertain, challenging, or interdependent – helps paint reality in ways that emphasize that no one is supposed to have all the answers. This lowers the hurdle for speaking up. It reminds people that their input is welcome – because it’s needed.*


---
Page: 222

*A good question is one motivated by genuine curiosity or by a desire to give someone a voice. Questions cry out for answers; they create a vacuum that serves as a voice opportunity for someone. Especially when a question is directed at an individual (and expressed in a way that conveys curiosity), a small safe zone is automatically created. By asking a question, you have conveyed, “I am interested in what you have to say.” In so doing, you have created a safe space that helps one or more others to of f er their thinking.*


---
Page: 222

*you can create psychological safety by choosing to listen actively to what peo-ple say and by responding with interest, building on their ideas, or giving feedback. True listening conveys respect – and in subtle but powerful ways reinforces the idea that a person’s full self is welcome here. Note that this does not mean you have to agree with what some-one said. Y ou don’t even have to like it. But you do have to appreciate the ef f ort it took for her to say it.*


---
Page: 223

*By being willing to acknowledge that you are a fallible human being, you give permission to others to do likewise. Removing your mask helps others remove theirs. Of course, this means acting as if you feel psychologically safe, even if you might not be fully there yet. Sometimes, you have to take an interpersonal risk to lower interpersonal risk.*

*let’s remember the fallacy of sampling on the dependent variable, a classic error in research. In other words, the success in question may in fact be explained by the leader’s arrogance and top-down approach;

*the companies motivating thoughtful people to ask this question may be one of those rare cases of a genius at the helm who indeed has all the answers. Steve Jobs comes to mind. To the extent that you feel you fall into that category – a rare genius who has perfect pitch in terms of what the market wants – you may be able to specify the work that needs to be done clearly enough for others to merely execute.

(Meanwhile, we just might learn something, which can also be helpful).
Compassion is the self-discipline to imagine and remember that everyone faces hurdles. All people are up against something – small or large – that frustrates them or keeps them up at night. The more you understand what others are up against, the more you sponta-neously do things that help build work relationships that are resilient and strong, as needed for getting the work done. Finally, commitment matters because if you demonstrate your dedication to achieving the organization’s goals, it can be contagious.*
