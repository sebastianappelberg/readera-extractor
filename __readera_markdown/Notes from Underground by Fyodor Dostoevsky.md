*In the social displacement of an imported culture, Dostoevsky perceived a more profound human displacement, a spiritual void filled with foreign content.*

**I wonder if it's harder to become spiritually satisfied in a country that's on the periphery of influence. Sweden has imported tons of American culture, has that made our chests hollow?

*Yes, I will always do what I want. I will never sacrifice anything, not even a whim, for the sake of something I do not desire. What I want, with all my heart, is to make people happy. In this lies my happiness. Mine! Can you hear that, you, in your underground hole?*

**I like powerful evocative ways of expressing opinion through characters, especially if it feels like an authentic thought of the character himself.

Page: 13

*Hence the formal inventiveness of Notes from Underground: its striking language, unlike any literary prose ever written; its multiple and conflicting tonalities; the oddity of its reversed structure, which seems random but all at once reveals its deeper coherence —“chatter … resolved by an unexpected catastrophe,” as Dostoevsky described it to his brother. (“All Dostoevsky’s novels were written for the sake of the catastrophe,” the critic Konstantin Mochulsky observed. “This is the law of the new ‘expressive art’ that he created. Only upon  arriving at the finale do we understand the composition’s perfection and the inexhaustible depth of its design.”)*

**A composition that requires full absorption of it is to be very considerate of the composition itself. It puts a lot of responsibility on the consumer of the art.

*Unity is not singularity but wholeness, a holding together, a harmony, all of which imply plurality. What the principle of this harmony is, the underground man cannot say; he has never found it. But he knows he has not found it; he knows, because his inner disharmony, his dividedness, which is the source of his suffering, is also the source of consciousness. Here we come upon one of the deep springs of Dostoevsky’s later work – not his thinking (Dostoevsky was not a thinker, or, rather, he was a plurality of thinkers), but his artistic embodiment of reality.*

**I like the weight put on plurality. I cannot imagine a positive worldview without it. Taking it away implies violence.

*The reason I’ve begun to speak is that I keep wanting to find out for certain: do other people have such pleasures? I’ll explain to you: the pleasure here lay precisely in the too vivid consciousness of one’s own humiliation; in feeling that one had reached the ultimate wall; that, bad as it is, it cannot be otherwise; that there is no way out for you, that you will never change into a different person; that even if you had enough time and faith left to change yourself into something different, you probably would not wish to change; and even if you did wish it, you would still not do anything, because in fact there is perhaps nothing to change into. And chiefly,  and finally, all this occurs according to the normal and basic laws of heightened consciousness and the inertia that follows directly from these laws, and consequently there is not only nothing you can do to change yourself, but there is simply nothing to do at all. So it turns out, for example, as a result of heightened consciousness: right, you’re a scoundrel – as if it were a consolation for the scoundrel himself to feel that he is indeed a scoundrel.*

**He captures the feeling of an inner conflict and inner beating of oneself. A nihilistic, narcissistic, inconsistent inner voice. I especially like the part that mentions finding peace in knowing your a piece of crap, as somehow a very poor consolation of it.

Page: 34

*For them a wall is not a deflection, as it is, for example, for us, people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not a pretext for turning back, a pretext which our sort usually doesn’t believe in but is always very glad to have.*

**We're happy with bullshit, we welcome it. Why do we do that? Why do we enjoy self-deception?

Page: 35

*For forty years on end it will recall its offense to the last, most shameful details, each time adding even more shameful details of its own, spitefully taunting and chafing itself with its fantasies. It will be ashamed of its fantasies, but all the same it will recall everything, go over everything, heap all sorts of figments on itself, under the pretext that they, too, could have happened, and forgive nothing. It may even begin to take  revenge, but somehow in snatches, with piddling things, from behind the stove, incognito, believing neither in its right to revenge itself nor in the success of its vengeance, and knowing beforehand that it will suffer a hundred times more from all its attempts at revenge than will the object of its vengeance, who will perhaps not even scratch at the bite.*

**When you're lashing out in spite, nothing you do restores justice for yourself and you know it. And the other person is probably ignorant of your spiteful attempts at getting justice. It's a horrible existence and you can dig yourself infinitely deep down in the dirt.

*“Perhaps,” you will add, grinning, “those who have never been slapped will also not understand” – thereby politely hinting that I, too, may have experienced a slap in my life, and am therefore speaking as a connoisseur. I’ll bet that’s what you think. But calm yourselves, gentlemen, I have not received any slaps, though it’s all quite the same to me whatever you may think about it. Perhaps I myself am sorry for having dealt out too few slaps in my life. But enough, not another word on this subject which you find so extremely interesting.*

**I appreciate his dialogue with the reader. And I appreciate the truth in what he denies to be the truth. Going deep into emotions most likely means you're speaking from experience.

*Impossibility – meaning a stone wall? What stone wall? Well, of course, the laws of nature, the conclusions of natural science, mathematics. Once it’s proved to you, for example, that you descended from an ape, there’s no use making a wry face, just take it for what it is. Once  it’s proved to you that, essentially speaking, one little drop of your own fat should be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your fellow men, and that in this result all so-called virtues and obligations and other ravings and prejudices will finally be resolved, go ahead and accept it, there’s nothing to be done, because two times two is – mathematics. Try objecting to that.*

**This touches on how science infringes on our way of living our lives. Science says it's so so shut up. It's essentially critiquing the bad philosophy of deferring to science. And that science is bad for making moral judgements.

Page: 37

*as it turns out, there isn’t even anyone to be angry with; that there is no object to be found, and maybe never will be; that it’s all a sleight-of-hand, a stacked deck, a cheat, that it’s all just slops – nobody knows what and nobody knows who, but in spite of all the uncertainties and stacked decks, it still hurts, and the more uncertain you are, the more it hurts!*

**I don't really know what this means. Is he saying that if you look deep enough, you see that the self is not real and that the world constructed by it is equally not real? 

**Maybe it's the paradox that we claim that the universe is completely knowable yet we know nothing of it. All is uncertain but to feel anxiety about it is frowned upon because the world is knowable so don't cry about it.

Page: 38

*It’s a good example, gentlemen, and I shall develop it. In these moans there is expressed, first, all the futility of our pain, so humiliating for our consciousness, and all the lawfulness of nature, on which, to be sure, you spit, but from which you suffer all the same, while it does not. There is expressed the consciousness that your enemy is nowhere to be found, and yet there is pain; the consciousness that, despite all possible Wagenheims,6 you are wholly the slave of your teeth*

**It feels like he is talking about the lack of free will over the contents of our minds. And also of the cosmos as a cause for it all, but it's completely disembodied, ethereal, something that you can't touch and put blame on. 

---
Page: 40

*NO, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE, how is it at all possible for a man to have the slightest respect for himself, if he has presumed to find pleasure even in the very sense of his own humiliation? I am not speaking this way now out of some cloying repentance. And, generally, I hated saying: “Forgive me, papa, I won’t do it again” – not because I was incapable of saying it, but, on the contrary, perhaps precisely because I was all too capable of it.*

**It's like he is describing our learning of how to bullshit and how we fall in love with that skill. And that we could fall for it is despicable. 

---
Page: 40

*Observe yourselves more closely, gentlemen, and you’ll understand that it is so. I made up adventures and devised a life for myself so as to live, at least somehow, a little. How many times it happened to me – well, say, for example, to feel offended, just so, for no reason, on purpose; and I’d know very well that I felt offended for no reason, that I was affecting it, but you can drive yourself so far that in the end, really, you do indeed get offended.*

**As we start taking pleasure in knee-jerk reactions, they start taking more and more control over us. It starts innocently but ends in wickedness. He seems to not only refer to knee-jerk reactions but all kinds of bullshit. It's like there's a fleeting joy found in it all, while we know that what drives it is trying to flee from suffering. 

---
Page: 40

*Deep in one’s soul it’s hard to believe one is suffering, mockery is stirring there, but all the same I suffer, and in a real, honest-to-god way, I get jealous, lose my temper … And all that from boredom, gentlemen, all from boredom; crushed by inertia.*

**Even though our suffering is an illusion we suffer all the same. 

---
Page: 41

*ingenuous people and active figures are all active simply because they are dull and narrow minded. How to explain it? Here’s how: as a consequence of their narrow-mindedness, they take the most immediate and secondary causes for the primary ones, and thus become convinced more quickly and easily than others that they  have found an indisputable basis for their doings, and so they feel at ease; and that, after all, is the main thing.*

**He is attacking the intelligentsia. They find a false sense of certainty in shallow explanations. They care more about finding certainty than truth. 

---
Page: 41

*a man takes revenge because he finds justice in it. That means he has found a primary cause, a basis – namely, justice. So he is set at ease on all sides and, consequently, takes his revenge calmly and successfully, being convinced that he is doing an honest and just thing. Whereas I do not see any justice here, nor do I find any virtue in it, and, consequently, if I set about taking revenge, it will be solely out of wickedness. Wickedness could, of course, overcome everything, all my doubts, and thus could serve quite successfully in place of a primary cause, precisely in that it is not a cause. But what’s to be done if there is also no wickedness in me? (I did begin with that just now.) The spite in me, again as a consequence of those cursed laws of consciousness, undergoes a chemical breakdown. Before your eyes the object vanishes, the reasons evaporate, the culprit is not to be found, the offense becomes not an offense but a fatum, something like a toothache, for which no one is to blame, and, consequently, what remains is again the same way out – that is, to give the wall a painful beating.*

**He uses justice as an example, where if we take a narrow view of the causality of the source of our revenge we take action and find satisfaction in what is actually a false justice. If we widen our aperture, all of a sudden we have so much causality that we get none. All causality chains lead back to the ultimate primary cause and then it becomes the same thing as saying nothing is to blame, it was just the will of the universe. 

---
Page: 42

*The result: a soap  bubble, and inertia. Oh, gentlemen, perhaps I really regard myself as an intelligent man only because throughout my entire life I’ve never been able to start or finish anything. Granted, granted I’m a babbler, a harmless, irksome babbler, as we all are. But what’s to be done if the sole and express purpose of every intelligent man is babble – that is, a deliberate pouring from empty into void.*

**Either we have something fragile and fake, or we have paralysis. The only thing we can reasonably due is shout at this conundrum. To shout from to nothingness that is us into the nothingness that is the world.

Page: 47

*What is it that civilization softens in us? Civilization cultivates only a versatility of sensations in man, and … decidedly nothing else. And through the development of this versatility, man may even reach the point of finding pleasure in blood. Indeed, this has already happened to him. Have you noticed that the most refined blood-shedders have almost all been the most civilized gentlemen, to whom the various Attilas and Stenka Razins13 sometimes could not hold a candle?*

**It might be pure arrogance to say that civilization has made us more moral. In a sense what we've done is create the most elaborate machinery to sweep all suffering we're creating under a rug. What's worse is that now when we "know" better but still cause so much suffering, we're not only immoral, we're hypocritical.

*when was it, to begin with, in all these thousands of years, that man acted solely for his own profit? What is to be done with the millions of facts testifying to how people knowingly, that is, fully understanding their real profit, would put it in second place and throw themselves onto another path, a risk, a perchance, not compelled by anyone or anything, but precisely as if they simply did not want the designated path, and stubbornly, willfully  pushed off onto another one, difficult, absurd, searching for it all but in the dark. So, then, this stubbornness and willfulness were really more agreeable to them than any profit … Profit! What is profit? And will you take it upon yourself to define with perfect exactitude precisely what man’s profit consists in? And what if it so happens that on occasion man’s profit not only may but precisely must consist in sometimes wishing ‘what is bad for himself, and not what is profitable?*

**He simultaneously shoots down the idea of humans as rational agents and the idea of having a never changing optimization metric that we should pursue.  

---
Page: 50

*One’s own free and voluntary wanting, one’s own caprice, however wild, one’s own fancy, though chafed sometimes to the point of madness – all this is that same most profitable profit, the omitted one, which does not fit into any classification, and because of which all systems and theories are constantly blown to the devil. And where did all these sages get the idea that man needs some normal, some virtuous wanting? What made them necessarily imagine that what man needs is necessarily a reasonably profitable wanting? Man needs only independent wanting, whatever this independence may cost and wherever it may lead. Well, and this wanting, the devil knows …*

**I thought that this desire, this absolute need to go against the stream, to be independent and autonomous was something rare. He speaks of it here like it's one of the most basic of human motivations. 

---
Page: 48

*Moreover: then, you say, science itself will teach man (though this is really a luxury in my opinion) that in fact he has neither will nor caprice, and never did have any, and that he himself is nothing but a sort of piano key or a sprig in an organ;14 and that, furthermore, there also exist in the world the laws of nature; so that whatever he does is done not at all according to his own wanting, but of itself, according to the laws of nature. Consequently, these laws of nature need only be discovered, and then man will no longer be answerable for his actions, and his life will become extremely easy. Needless to say, all human actions will then be calculated according to these laws, mathematically, like a table of logarithms, up to 108,000, and entered into a calendar; or, better still, some well-meaning publications will appear, like the present-day encyclopedic dictionaries, in which everything will be so precisely calculated and designated that there will no longer be any actions or adventures in the world.
And it is then – this is still you speaking – that new economic relations will come, quite ready-made, and also calculated with mathematical precision, so that all possible questions will vanish in an instant, essentially because they will have been given all possible answers. Then the crystal palace will get built.*

**Sharp critique against communism and weirdly also techno-utopianism. He is lashing out against the silliness of thinking that we'll reach a conclusion through science where life has been solved. Figured out. Nothing more to do. Man would sit on that for a couple of years until he got bored with it.

*if one day  they really find the formula for all our wantings and caprices – that is, what they depend on, by precisely what laws they occur, precisely how they spread, what they strive for in such-and-such a case, and so on and so forth; a real, mathematical formula, that is – then perhaps man will immediately stop wanting; what’s more, perhaps he will certainly stop. Who wants to want according to a little table? Moreover: he will immediately turn from a man into a sprig in an organ or something of the sort; because what is man without desires, without will, and without wantings, if not a sprig in an organ barrel? What do you think? – let’s reckon up the probabilities – can it happen or not?*

**Free will may be answerable by science, but the answer could be that it's inherently unpredictable. Or something in-between. 

---
Page: 51

*“Hm …” you decide, “our wantings are for the most part mistaken owing to a mistaken view of our profit. We sometimes want pure rubbish precisely because, in our stupidity, we see this rubbish as the easiest path to the attainment of some preconceived profit. Well, but when it’s all explained, worked out on a piece of paper (which is quite possible because, after all, it’s vile and senseless to believe beforehand that there are certain laws of nature which man will never learn) – then, to be sure, there will be no more so-called desires. For if wanting someday gets completely in cahoots with reason, then essentially we shall be reasoning and not wanting, because it really is impossible, for example, while preserving reason, to want senselessness and thus knowingly go against reason and wish yourself harm*

**Our motivation tends not to be grounded in reason, and we have a tendency to make decisions based on bullshit. And if we'd one day unite our desires with our reason we'd eventually want something unreasonable. 

**We should not dare to question the ultimate promise of science, to explain it all. 

---
Page: 53

*But I repeat to you for the hundredth time, there is only one case, one only, when man may purposely, consciously wish for himself even the harmful, the stupid, even what is stupidest of all: namely, so as to have the right to wish for himself even what is stupidest of all and not be bound by an obligation to wish for himself only what is intelligent.*

**The desire to feel free is what would make us detest a fully rational way of life. 

---
Page: 52

*Allow me to indulge my fancy a bit. You see: reason, gentlemen, is a fine thing, that is unquestionable, but reason is only reason and satisfies only man’s reasoning capacity, while wanting is a manifestation of the whole of life – that is, the whole of human life, including reason and various little itches. And though our life in this manifestation often turns out to be a bit of trash, still it is life and not just the extraction of a square root. I, for example, quite naturally want to live so as to satisfy my whole capacity for living, and not so as to satisfy just my reasoning capacity alone, which is some twentieth part of my whole capacity for living. What does reason know? Reason knows only what it has managed to learn (some things, perhaps, it will never learn; this is no consolation, but why not say it anyway?), while human nature acts as an entire whole, with everything that is in it, consciously and unconsciously, and though it lies, still it lives.*

**Life is greater than what's intelligible. 

---
Page: 53

*I even think the best definition of man is: a being that goes on two legs and is ungrateful. But that’s still not all; that’s still not his chief defect; his chiefest defect is his constant lack of good behavior – constant from the great flood to the Schleswig-Holstein period of man’s destiny. Lack of good behavior and, consequently, lack of good sense; for it has long been known that lack of good sense comes from nothing else but the lack of good behavior.*

**What part of humanity do I find most appalling, ridiculous, amazing, etc?

---
Page: 55

*And if he finds himself without means –  he will invent destruction and chaos, he will invent all kinds of suffering, and still have his own way! He will launch a curse upon the world, and since man alone is able to curse (that being his privilege, which chiefly distinguishes him from other animals), he may achieve his end by the curse alone – that is, indeed satisfy himself that he is a man and not a piano key! If you say that all this, the chaos and darkness and cursing, can also be calculated according to a little table, so that the mere possibility of a prior calculation will put a stop to it all and reason will claim its own – then he will deliberately go mad for the occasion, so as to do without reason and still have his own way! I believe in this, I will answer for this, because the whole human enterprise seems indeed to consist in man s proving to himself every moment that he is a man and not a sprig!*

**If you say that even the chaos and destruction is according to plan, then it's still more satisfying an option because you will lose all faculties involved in lamenting over the pickle at hand. 

---
Page: 57

*But man is a frivolous and unseemly being, and perhaps, similar to a chess player, likes only the process of achieving the goal, but not the goal itself. And who knows (one cannot vouch for it), perhaps the whole goal mankind strives for on earth consists just in this ceaselessness of the process of achievement alone, that is to say, in life itself, and not essentially in the goal, which, of course, is bound to be nothing other than two times two is four – that is, a formula; and two times two is four is no longer life, gentlemen, but the beginning of death. At least man has always somehow feared this two times two is four, and I fear it even now. Suppose all man ever does is search for this two times two is four; he crosses oceans, he sacrifices his life in the search; but to search it out, actually to find it – by God, he’s somehow afraid. For he senses that once he finds it, there will be nothing to search for.*

**The imbalance favored towards dopaminergic behavior causes us to feel stronger towards coming closer to the goal but feel a dump when reaching the goal. Reaching the ultimate goal would be the ultimate dump. There'd be no more achieving after it, there would be no more point to life after it. If achieving is all there is.

Page: 57

*And why are you so firmly, so solemnly convinced that only the normal and the positive, in short, that only wellbeing, is profitable for man? Is reason not perhaps mistaken as to profits? Maybe man does not love well-being only? Maybe he loves suffering just as much? Maybe suffering is just as profitable for him as well-being?*

**I believe this is what they're referring to in matrix when they say that a too perfect world doesn't fit everyone. Sometimes you need to feel pain to feel pleasure. 

---
Page: 60

*But so long as I live and desire – let my hand wither*

**Using phrases from other books actually enriches your on book. If you do it subtly that is. 

---
Page: 59

*But what’s to be done if I’ve taken it into my head that one does not live only for that, and that if one is to live, it had better be in a mansion? This is my wanting, this is my desire. You will scrape it out of me only when you change my desires. So, change them, seduce me with something else, give me a different ideal. But meanwhile I will not take a chicken coop for a palace. Let it even be so that the crystal edifice is a bluff, that by the laws of nature it should not even be, and that I’ve invented it only as a result of my own stupidity, as a result of certain old nonrational habits of our generation. But what do I care if it should not be? What difference does it make, since it exists in my desires, or, better, exists as long as my desires exist?*

**Is this critique against settling for what you have and shutting up? Don't deny your desires, but update them if you should find something more desirable. Even if what you desire is but a fantasy. Why should we deny ourselves? 

**I think the an answer can be found in modal confusion between the having and the being mode. It's not that you should deny your desires, it's that you should relate to things in the most modaly suitable way. You may have desires, and that's alright, but that's not the same thing as being happy.

*In every man’s memories there are such things as he will reveal not to everyone, but perhaps only to friends. There are also such as he will reveal not even to friends, but only to himself, and that in secret. Then, finally, there are such as a man is afraid to reveal even to himself, and every decent man will have accumulated quite a few things of this sort.*

**Self-deception is ubiquitous. What is it about the things we do not wish to reveal to ourselves that makes them so? It's the discrepancy between the kind of person we imagine ourselves being and the kind of person we are in reality. 

**The things we do not reveal to anyone but ourselves is the discrepancy between what kind of person we think the other person wants us to be and the kind of person we've already accepted that we are.

*THE FINAL END, gentlemen: better to do nothing! Better conscious inertia! And so, long live the underground! Though I did say that I envy the normal man to the point of uttermost bile, still I do not want to be him on those conditions in which I see him (though, all the same, I shall not stop envying him. No, no, the underground is in any case more profitable!). There one can at least … Eh! but here, too, I’m lying! Lying, because I myself know, like two times two, that it is not at all the underground that is better, but something different, completely different, which I thirst for but cannot ever find! Devil take the underground!*

**Through the text you can really feel the real human emotions, the inconsistency, the constant inner conflict, the dynamics of our being. 

---
Page: 63

*But here is another thing: for what and to what end, in fact, do I want to write? If not for the public, then why not simply recall everything mentally, without transferring it to paper?
Right, sir; but on paper it will somehow come out more solemnly. There’s something imposing in it, there will be more of a judgment on oneself, it will gain in style. Besides: maybe I will indeed get relief from the writing. Today, for example, I’m particularly oppressed by one distant recollection. I recalled it clearly the other day, and it has since stayed with me like a nagging musical tune that refuses to be gotten rid of. And yet one must get rid of it. I have hundreds of such recollections; but some one out of a hundred emerges every now and then and oppresses me. I believe for some reason that if I write it down, I shall then be rid of it. So why not try?
Finally: I’m bored, and I constantly do nothing. And writing things down really seems like work. They say work makes a man good and honest. Well, here’s a chance, at least.*

**This is an author trying to give his reasons for why he writes. In his case it's for some sort of catharsis. For a way to self transcend.

Page: 62

*is it possible to be perfectly candid with oneself and not be afraid of the whole truth? I will observe incidentally: Heine insists that faithful autobiographies are almost impossible, and that a man is sure to tell a pack of lies about himself. In his opinion, Rousseau, for example, most certainly told a pack of lies about himself in his confessions, and even did so intentionally, out of vanity.*

**Is it possible to speak fully truthfully, directly from your heart, the purest of thought? Pure not as in good, but as rid of bullshit. Of lies that are there to please yourself and others. 

---
Page: 67

*But whether I despised them or set them above me, I used to drop my eyes before almost everyone I met. I even made experiments: will I be able to endure so-and-so’s glance on me? – and I was always the first to drop my eyes. This tormented me to the point of fury.*

**I wonder what it is in me that makes me do the same. Is it a natural part of self-loathing? 

---
Page: 71

*At home, to begin with, I mainly used to read. I wished to stifle with external sensations all that was ceaselessly boiling up inside me. And among external sensations the only one possible for me was reading. Reading was, of course, a great help – it stirred, delighted, and tormented me. But at times it bored me terribly. I still wanted to move about, and so I’d suddenly sink into some murky, subterranean, vile debauch – not a great, but a measly little debauch. There were measly little passions in me, sharp, burning, because of my permanent, morbid irritability. I was given to hysterical outbursts, with tears and convulsions. Apart from reading I had nowhere to turn – that is, there was nothing I could then respect in my surroundings, nothing I would be drawn to. What’s more, anguish kept boiling up; a hysterical thirst for contradictions, contrasts, would appear, and so I’d set out on debauchery. It is not at all to justify myself that I’ve been doing all this talking … But no! that’s a lie! I precisely wanted to justify myself. I make this little note for myself, gentlemen. I don’t want to lie. I’ve given my word.*

**When they didn't have as many external sensations to numb themselves with, did they have to enjoy the ones they had more?

---
Page: 71

*I was not drunk, but what do you want of me – anguish can eat a man into such hysterics! But it came to nothing. I proved incapable even of jumping out the window and left without having had any fight.*

**What is this feeling that drives people into doing weird stuff and then chickening out? I've done it myself several times.

---
Page: 75

*I reveled in my spite as I watched him, and … each time spitefully swerved out of his way. It tormented me that even in the street I simply could not be on an equal footing with him. “Why is it invariably you who swerve first?” I kept nagging at myself, in furious hysterics, sometimes waking up, say, between two and three in the morning. “Why precisely you and not him? There’s no law that says so, it’s not written anywhere? Well, then let it be equal, as is usual when men of delicacy meet: he can yield by half, and you by half, and so you will pass mutually respecting each other.” But it was never so, and I still kept swerving, and he did not even notice that I was giving way to him. And then a most astonishing thought suddenly dawned on me. “What,” I fancied, “what if I meet him and … do not step aside? Deliberately do not step aside, even  if I have to shove him – eh? how will that be?”*

**What is this feeling of wanting to assert yourself? Of demanding the respect of others? Why do we care so deeply about it? Is it a deep desire to dominate? Not to be dominated? And why are we at the same time so cowardly? It's like being torn apart from the inside. Maybe it's opponent processing in action, a balance that makes sure you don't become a target and at the same time don't get into lethal conflict.

*A secondary role was incomprehensible to me, and that was precisely why, in reality, I so calmly filled the last. Either hero or mud, there was no in between.*

**Becoming a mid is the mid's, or perhaps the almost intellectual's, worst nightmare.

*Everything, however, would always end most happily with a lazy and rapturous transition to art – that is, to beautiful forms of being, quite ready-made, highly stolen from poets and novelists, and adapted to every possible service or demand.*

**Even the greatest steal from others. They take it, and shamelessly play with it. 

---
Page: 81

*However, you’re right, it is indeed both vulgar and vile. And what’s vilest is that I’ve now started justifying myself before you. And viler still is that I’m now making this remark. Enough, however; otherwise there will be no end to it: things will go on getting viler and viler …*

**You can tell that the author is very familiar with thought loops, and especially ones that spiral downwards.

*They talked about excise, negotiations in the Senate, salaries, promotions, His Excellency, ways of making oneself liked, and so on and so forth. I had patience enough to sit it out by these people like a fool for four hours on end, listening to them, myself not daring or knowing how to begin talking with them about anything. My mind would grow dull, I’d break into a sweat several times, paralysis hovered over me; but this was good and beneficial. On returning home, I’d put off for a while my desire to embrace the whole of mankind.*

**When I'm lonely for a while I can get outbursts similar to this.

*I hated them terribly, though I was perhaps worse than they  were. They paid me back in kind and did not conceal their loathing for me. But I no longer had any wish for their love; on the contrary, I constantly thirsted for their humiliation. To rid myself of their derision, I purposely began to study as hard as I could and worked my way into the number of the best. This made an impression. Besides, they began little by little to realize that I had by then read such books as they were unable to read, and understood such things (not part of our special course) as they had never even heard of. This they regarded wildly and derisively, but morally they submitted, the more so as even the teachers paid attention to me in this respect. The derision stopped, but the animosity remained, and cold, strained relations set in.*

**I wonder what would have happened to me if I wasn't a little smarter than average. Would I have perhaps not needed the moral superiority? I'm happy I had something that couldn't be taken away.

*Towards the end I myself could not stand it: as I grew older, a need for people, for friends, developed. I tried to start getting closer with some; but the attempt always came out unnaturally and would simply end of itself. I also once had a friend. But I was already a despot in my soul; I wanted to have unlimited power over his soul; I wanted to instill in him a contempt for his surrounding milieu; I demanded of him a haughty and final break with that milieu. I frightened him with my passionate friendship; I drove him to tears, to convulsions; he was a naive, self-giving soul; but once he had given himself wholly to me, I immediately started to hate him and pushed him away – as if I had needed him only to gain a victory over him, only to bring him into subjection. But I could not be victorious over everyone; my friend was also not like any of them, and represented the rarest exception.*

**Whatever sickness this man has in terms of dealing with friends, I have it too.

*I remained alone for a moment. Disorder, leftovers, a broken wine glass on the floor, spilt wine, cigarette butts, drunkenness and delirium in my head, tormenting anguish in my heart, and, finally, the servant, who had seen everything and heard everything, and kept peeking curiously into my eyes.
“There!” I cried out. “Either they’ll all fall on their knees, embrace my legs, and beg for my friendship, or … or I’ll slap Zverkov’s face!”*

**What is it about this person that drives him to humiliate himself so much? Does he truly want friendship but doesn't know know? Is it a point of stubbornness? Is it a point of status?

*The thing was that at the same moment I could see, more clearly and vividly than anyone else in the entire world, the whole, most odious absurdity of my suppositions, and the whole other side of the coin, but …
“Faster, coachman, faster, you rogue!”
“Eh, master!” said the backbone of the nation.
I suddenly felt cold all over.
“And wouldn’t it be better … better … to go straight home now? Oh, my God! Why, why did I invite myself to this dinner yesterday! But no, impossible! And that threehour stroll from table to stove? No, they, they and no one else, must pay me for that stroll! They must wash away that dishonor!”*

**Why does one let honor so cloud ones judgment?

*What was to be done? To go there was impossible – the result would be nonsense; to leave things as they were was also impossible, because the result would then be … “Lord! How can I leave it! After such offenses! No!” I exclaimed, rushing back to the sled, “it’s predestined, it’s fate! Drive on, drive on – there!”*

**He's aware that he's spiraling downwards, and it seems like he can't admit that there's no good reason to. Is he displaying what the man underground talked about? Where man often does not act in his best interest. It's almost like he doesn't have free will to stop it.

*But, of course, they had already had time to disperse …
In front of me stood a person with a stupid smile, the hostess herself, who knew me slightly. A moment later the door opened, and another person came in.
Paying no attention to anything, I was pacing the room and, I think, talking to myself. It was as if I had been saved from death, and I joyfully sensed it with my whole being: for I would have slapped him, I would certainly, certainly have slapped him! But now they’re not here and … everything’s vanished, everything’s changed!*

**He seems happy that circumstances out of his control forced him not to do something. It's like he is happy that he no longer has responsibility over his actions.

*And no one, no one ought to know what goes on between a husband and wife if they love each other. And whatever quarrel they may have – they shouldn’t call even their mother to be their judge or hear them tell about each other. They are their own judges. Love – is God’s mystery, and should be hidden from all other eyes, whatever happens. It’s holier that way, and better. They respect each other more, and so much is founded on respect. And if there was love once, if they were married out of love, why should love pass? Can’t it be sustained? It rarely happens that it can’t be. Well, and if the husband proves to be a kind and honest man, how can love pass? The first married love will pass, true, but then an even better love will come. Then their souls will grow close; they’ll decide all their doings together, they’ll have no secrets from each other. And when children arrive, then all of it, even the hardest times, will look like happiness; one need only love and have courage. Now even work brings joy, now even if you must occasionally deny yourself bread for the children’s sake, still  there is joy.*

**Not experiencing hardships is not a source of joy. In fact you can feel joy in hard times. When you have purpose you can be joyful regardless of your circumstances.

*I knew I’d been speaking stiffly, affectedly, even bookishly; in short, I couldn’t speak any other way than “as if from a book.” But that didn’t trouble me; I knew, I sensed that I’d be understood, and that this very bookishness might even help things along. But now, having achieved my effect, I suddenly turned coward.*

**Self-criticism makes the character more likeable and relatable.

*But the more evening advanced and the twilight thickened, the more my impressions and, after them, my thoughts as well, kept changing and tangling. Something within me, deep in my heart and conscience, would not die, refused to die, and betrayed itself in a burning anguish. I loitered about mainly on the most crowded business streets*

**A very subtle description of day after anxiety that creeps in slowly as the lingering protection from your sleep goes away.

*That whole evening, when I’d already returned home, when it was already past nine and by my reckoning Liza simply could not come, I still kept imagining her, and I recalled her, mostly, in one and the same position. Namely, of all that had happened yesterday, I pictured one moment especially vividly, it was when I lighted up the room with a match and saw her pale, distorted face with its tormented eyes. And how pathetic, how unnatural, how twisted her smile was at that moment! But I did not know then that even after fifteen years I would still be picturing Liza precisely with the pathetic, twisted, needless smile she had at that moment.*

**What a beautiful picture it paints of a girl twisting her smile, perhaps not even her but the core of her being taking over her body, to muster some futile response to full existential despair.

*“And it took so little, so little talk,” I thought in passing, “such a little idyll (an affected idyll besides, a contrived, a bookish one), to succeed in turning a whole human soul the way I wanted. There’s virginity for you! There’s the freshness of the soil!”
At times the thought occurred to me of going to her myself, “to tell her everything” and prevail upon her not to come to me. But here, at this thought, such spite rose up in me that I think I would simply have squashed this “cursed” Liza if she’d suddenly happened to be there, insulted her, spat upon her, driven her out, struck her!*

**The author manages to make it seem like the character very much tries to hide, from himself, the fact that what he is most afraid of is that he didn't manage to manipulate the girl into loving him. Or even worse that the fact that he thinks deep down that he doesn't deserve her love, that he could not possibly be loved by anyone.

*“There wouldn’t be any of this if it weren’t for Liza!” I decided to myself. Then, after a moment’s pause, pompously and solemnly, but slowly and with a pounding heart, I myself proceeded behind his screen.*

**This whole interlude is the character spiraling downwards just to run away from his real fear related to Liza.

*“Liza, do you despise me?” I said, looking at her point-blank, trembling with impatience to find out what she thought.
She became embarrassed, and was unable to reply.
“Drink your tea!” I said spitefully. I was angry with myself, but, naturally, she was going to bear the brunt of it. A terrible spite against her suddenly boiled up in my heart; I think I could simply have killed her. To be revenged on her, I swore mentally not to speak even one word to her from then on. “It’s she who caused it all,” I thought.*

**Why do we lash out so harshly against others when we feel vulnerable? Like cornered animals we just strike at everyone and everything around us.

*I was so used to thinking and imagining everything from books, and to picturing everything in the world to myself as I had devised it beforehand in my dreams, that at first I didn’t even understand this strange circumstance. What occurred was this: Liza, whom I had insulted and crushed, understood far more than I imagined. She understood from it all what a woman, if she loves sincerely, always understands before anything else – namely, that I myself was unhappy.*

**It's such a wonderful monolog that contains truths and self-deceptions, which makes it all the more human. And her, the person he tries with all his might to crush, how can she want to be kind to him? It's as she sees herself in him, and at the same from some unthinking instinct wants to drag him up from the spiraling.

*First, I was no longer able to love, because, I repeat, for me to love meant to tyrannize and to preponderize morally. All my life I’ve been incapable even of picturing any other love, and I’ve reached the point now of sometimes thinking that love consists precisely in the right, voluntarily granted by the beloved object, to be tyrannized over. In my underground dreams as well, I never pictured love to myself otherwise than as a struggle; for me it always started from hatred and ended with moral subjugation, and afterwards I couldn’t even picture to myself what to do with the subjugated object.*

**Completely stuck in the having mode. What is it that drives it? Is it the shame that has piled up? Is it the inexperience of living life?

*I stopped by the table next to the chair on which she had been sitting, and stared senselessly before me. About a minute passed; suddenly I gave a great start: there before me, on the table, I saw … in short, I saw a crumpled blue five-rouble bill, the very one I had pressed into her hand a moment before. It  was that bill; it couldn’t have been any other; there wasn’t any other in the house. So she had managed to fling it from her hand onto the table just as I jumped away to the opposite corner.*

**This action, this terrible thing that he did, that he didn't even seem to reflect over, was what destroyed any possibility of a relationship with her. All the things he did up to now was forgivable, but to uthinkingly disrespect her that way and to demean himself and their shared feelings must've been the final straw.

*Such were my reveries as I sat at home that evening, barely alive from the pain in my soul. Never before had I endured so much suffering and repentance; but could there have been even the slightest doubt, as I went running out of the apartment, that I would turn back halfway? Never have I met Liza again, or heard anything about her. I will also add that for a long time I remained pleased with the phrase about the usefulness of insult and hatred, even though I myself almost became sick then from anguish.
Even now, after so many years, all this comes out somehow none too well in my recollection. Many things come out none too well now in my recollections, but … shouldn’t I just end my Notes here? I think it was a mistake to begin writing them. At least I’ve felt ashamed all the while I’ve been writing this story: so it’s no longer literature, but corrective punishment.*

**He is a powerful writer. Never have a I been exposed to someone who brings on that much existential angst in his characters.

*As far as I myself am concerned, I have merely carried to an extreme in my life what you have not dared to carry even halfway, and, what’s more, you’ve taken your cowardice for good sense, and found comfort in thus deceiving yourselves. So that I, perhaps, come out even more “living” than you. Take a closer look! We don’t even know where the living lives now, or what it is, or what it’s called! Leave us to ourselves, without a book, and we’ll immediately get confused, lost – we won’t know what to join, what to hold to, what to love and what to hate, what to respect and what to despise. It’s a burden for us even to be men – men with real, our own bodies and blood; we’re ashamed of it, we consider it a disgrace, and keep trying to be some unprecedented omni-men. We’re stillborn, and have long ceased to be born of living fathers, and we like this more and more. We’re acquiring a taste for it. Soon we’ll contrive to be born somehow from an idea. But enough; I don’t want to write any more ’from Underground” …*

**What does be mean by us not living real life anymore? Is it a critique of romanticism and idealism? This whole book has been an expose on a character having true human emotions. Messy, paradoxical, irrational but somehow ultra rational.
