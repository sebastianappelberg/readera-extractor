*“The success of the masterpieces seems to lie not so much in their freedom from faults—indeed we tolerate the grossest errors in them all— but in the immense persuasiveness of a mind which has completely mastered its perspective.”*

**This expresses, much more eloquently, what I mean when I say that I just jive with some pieces of art more than others and it's when I think that I can see all the beauty that the artist tries to display. I get an aha moment which leads to an awe moment.

*Our constant challenge is to remain faithful to the historical material, allowing our present perspective to enrich, but not distort, the various ideas and world views we examine.*

**I'd say that it's a useful skill to have when looking forward into the future as well.

*We begin with the Greeks. It was some twenty-five centuries ago that the Hellenic world brought forth that extraordinary flowering of culture that marked the dawn of Western civilization.*

**I just got a striking feeling that 2500 years is nothing. It's so extremely recent.

*Speaking in these broad terms, and mindful of the inexactness of such generalities, we may say that the Greek universe was ordered by a plurality of timeless essences which underlay concrete reality, giving it form and meaning. These archetypal principles included the mathematical forms of geometry and arithmetic; cosmic opposites such as light and dark, male and female, love and hate, unity and multiplicity; the forms of man (anthrōpos) and other living creatures; and the Ideas of the Good, the Beautiful, the Just, 1 and other absolute moral and aesthetic values. In the pre-philosophical Greek mind, these archetypal principles took the form of mythic personifications such as Eros, Chaos, Heaven and Earth (Ouranos and Gaia), as well as more fully personified figures such as Zeus, Prometheus, and Aphrodite. In this perspective, every aspect of existence was patterned and permeated by such fundamentals. Despite the continuous flux of phenomena in both the outer world and inner experience, there could yet be distinguished specific immutable structures or essences, so definite and enduring they were believed to possess an independent reality of their own.*

**I've felt this while under the influence of psychedelics. It's unclear to me what comes first, the forms or reality. In a sense the forms are just patterned projections our mind think makes sense. Even mathematics is not precise enough to capture reality. Our interpretation of reality is real, but whether it's accurate is a different question.

*It seemed evident to Plato that when many objects share a common property—as all human beings share “humanness” or as all white stones share “whiteness”—that property is not limited to a specific material instance in space and time. It is immaterial, beyond spatiotemporal limitation, and transcendent to its many instances. A particular thing may cease to be, but not the universal property that the particular thing embodied. The universal is a separate entity from the particular and, because it is beyond change and never passes away, is superior in its reality.*

**Imagine that everything in the universe that was green was poofed out of existence. That wouldn't mean that the idea of green would disappear. Ideas are in a sense immortal. Genes codify certain biological ideas, they carry forth something that's immortal. 

---
Page: 21

*The Platonic perspective thus asks the philosopher to go through the particular to the universal, and beyond the appearance to the essence. It assumes not only that such insight is possible, but that it is mandatory for the attainment of true knowledge. Plato directs the philosopher’s attention away from the external and concrete, from taking things at face value, and points “deeper” and “inward,” so that one may “awaken” to a more profound level of reality. He asserts that the objects one perceives with one’s senses are actually crystallizations of more primary essences, which can be apprehended only by the active, intuitive mind.*

**What level of granularity should one view the ideas with? In some sense the all ideas are built out of smaller ideas. Where does it stop?

---
Page: 22

*Knowledge derived from the senses is merely opinion and is fallible by any nonrelative standard. Only knowledge derived directly from the Ideas is infallible and can be justifiably called real knowledge.*

**I believe that Deutsch's ideas are similar with the added caveat that we will never get all the way to the pure forms. There is objective truth but we will ever be at the beginning of the infinite path to the absolute purest form. 

---
Page: 23

*Platonic Ideas are objective. They do not depend on human thought, but exist entirely in their own right. They are perfect patterns embedded in the very nature of things. The Platonic Idea is, as it were, not merely a human idea but the universe’s idea, an ideal entity that can express itself externally in concrete tangible form or internally as a concept in the human mind. It is a primordial image or formal essence that can manifest in various ways and on various levels, and is the foundation of reality itself.*

**The notion of discovering truths in math, stories, nature, etc. Is very congruent with there being a static source of truth. I'm not sure if it's compatible with a dynamic universe in which creativity can exist. Though if the universe is infinite that'd mean that all possible combinations of everything will exist. But can the universe contain its own death? That would be an idea that cannot exist in the universe, meaning that it has potential for dynamics. 

**If the universe was too dynamic, discovering truths would be in some sense impossible. We would be able to discover processes perhaps, but the base would be constantly shifting.

Page: 25

*Plato presented several formidable arguments against his own theory, pointing out questions concerning the nature of the Ideas— how many kinds are there, what are their relations to each other and to the sensible world, what is the precise meaning of “participation,” how is knowledge of them possible—the responses to which raised seemingly unsolvable problems and inconsistencies. Some of these questions, which Plato posed perhaps as much out of dialectical vigor as from self-criticism, became the basis for later philosophers’ objections to the theory of Ideas.*

**Questioning oneself in that manner is very Socratic. The same goes for not arriving at a conclusion. 

---
Page: 25

*At times Plato seems to exalt the ideal over the empirical to such an extent that all concrete particulars are understood to be, as it were, only a series of footnotes to the transcendent Idea. At other times he seems to stress the intrinsic nobility of created things, precisely because they are embodied expressions of the divine and eternal.*

**What kind of form is our consciousness and intelligence?

---
Page: 26

*To sum up: From the Platonic perspective, the fundamentals of existence are the archetypal Ideas, which constitute the intangible substrate of all that is tangible. The true structure of the world is revealed not by the senses, but by the intellect, which in its highest state has direct access to the Ideas governing reality. All knowledge presupposes the existence of the Ideas. The archetypal realm, far from being an unreal abstraction or imaginary metaphor for the concrete world, is here considered to be the very basis of reality, that which determines its order and renders it knowable. To this end, Plato declared direct experience of the transcendent Ideas to be the philosopher’s primary goal and ultimate destination.*

**The concrete base reality may in fact be perfect, but our senses are lacking the resolution to sense it. 

**Hardware and software are intertwined, our intelligence arose from the hardware and the intelligence of our bodies helped shape the hardware. The entire system is adapted for reproduction and survival, not for getting closer to base reality. It just happens that being able to reason about base reality is a very big survival advantage.

*Depending on a specific dialogue’s context, Zeus, Apollo, Hera, Ares, Aphrodite, and the rest could signify actual deities, allegorical figures, character types, psychological attitudes, modes of experience, philosophic principles, transcendent essences, sources of poetic inspiration or divine communications, objects of conventional piety, unknowable entities, imperishable artifacts of the supreme creator, heavenly bodies, foundations of the universal order, or rulers and teachers of mankind. More than only literalistic metaphors, Plato’s gods defy strict definition, in one dialogue serving as fanciful characters in a didactic fable, in another commanding an undoubted ontological reality.*

**Characters and story are so extremely flexible. I wish I had the capacity to weave levels of abstraction and different ideas together eloquently. 

---
Page: 29

*For by speaking of Ideas on one page and gods on another in such analogous terms, Plato resolved, tenuously yet with weighty and enduring consequences, the central tension in the classical Greek mind between myth and reason.*

**Need there be a tension there? Is the tension useful in its own right? 

---
Page: 31

*Here, at the luminous dawn of the Western literary tradition, was captured the primordial mythological sensibility in which the events of human existence were perceived as intimately related to and informed by the eternal realm of gods and goddesses.*

**Joscha Bach's conceptualization of God is that it's the collective intelligence. The emergent whole that comes from what the parts care most deeply about. In that sense the idea of our lives as being influenced by gods is very relevant. 

---
Page: 31

*Even the towering figure of Homer himself suggested a peculiarly indivisible synthesis of the individual and the universal. The monumental epic poems were brought forth from a greater collective psyche, creations of the Hellenic racial imagination passed on, developed, and refined generation after generation, bard after bard. Yet within the established formulaic patterns of oral tradition that governed the epics’ composition there also lived an unmistakably personal particularity, a flexible individualism and spontaneity of style and vision. Thus “Homer” was ambiguously both an individual human poet and a collective personification of the entire ancient Greek memory.*

**Fractal ideas in art give it more depth.

*Against the backdrop of that opposition between human endeavor and divine stricture, between free will and fate, sin and retribution, the moral struggle of the protagonist unfolded.*

**Competing forces, contradictions, eternal pairs are important for creating a nuanced and interesting story.

*With the exception of the relatively autonomous Pythagoreans, the Hellenic mind before Socrates followed a definite, if at times ambiguous, direction away from the supernatural and toward the natural: from the divine to the mundane, from the mythical to the conceptual, from poetry and story to prose and analysis. To the more 22 critical intellects of this later age, the gods of the ancient poets’ stories seemed all too human, made in man’s own image, and increasingly dubious as real divine entities.*

**It's a bit weird that Christianity was able to appear after the Greeks have started to awaken intellectually. The humansim of the Renaissance laid the foundation for the atheist movements, and that had already been explored long before the most dominant religion of our time was conceived. 

---
Page: 43

*Yet, according to the Sophists, it did not matter if man had no certain insight into the world outside him. He could know only the contents of his own mind—appearances rather than essences—but these constituted the only reality that could be of valid concern to him. Other than appearances, a deeper stable reality could not be known, not only on account of man’s limited faculties, but more fundamentally because such a reality could not be said to exist outside of human conjecture.*

**The Sophists sounds like postmodernists. 

---
Page: 43

*The evidence of travelers’ reports, for example, suggested that social practices and religious beliefs were not absolutes but merely local human conventions, received pieties varying according to each nation’s customs with no fundamental relation either to nature or to divine commandment.*

**When too many new ideas that cannot be explained by the current paradigm you see people start craving for a shift. 

---
Page: 44

*Hence the Sophists concluded in favor of a flexible atheism or agnosticism in metaphysics and a situational morality in ethics. Since religious beliefs, political structures, and rules of moral conduct were now seen to be humanly created conventions, these were all open to fundamental questioning and change. After centuries of blind obedience to restrictive traditional attitudes, man could now free himself to pursue a program of enlightened self-interest. To discover by rational means what was most useful for man seemed a more intelligent strategy than to base one’s actions on belief in mythological deities or the absolutist assumptions of unprovable metaphysics.*

**What was the result to society of this paradigm? What came after it?

---
Page: 46

*Indeed, the whole development of reason now seemed to have undercut its own basis, with the human mind denying itself the capacity for genuine knowledge of the world.*

**The similarity between postmodernism and sophistry has to be well known. It's interesting that the same mode of thinking had the same effects back then as it seems to have now. Since there's no truth and nothing can be sacred, let's bend morality to serve us and let's make power and violence virtuous. The extreme left are very tyrannical in their approach.

*It is evident from these that Socrates was a man of singular character and intelligence, who was imbued with a passion for intellectual honesty and moral integrity rare for his or any other age. He insistently sought answers to questions that had not before been asked, attempted to undermine conventional assumptions and beliefs to provoke more careful thinking about ethical matters, and tirelessly compelled both himself and those with whom he conversed to seek a deeper understanding of what constituted a good life. His words and deeds embodied an abiding conviction that the act of rational self-criticism could free the human mind from the bondage of false opinion.*

**In a way he is the complete opposite of a postmodern sophist. Instead of doubting the existence of truth he has an unyielding will to discover it. He acknowledges that we're far from finding it but he has faith that it can be found. 

---
Page: 48

*His repeated demonstrations of human ignorance, both his own and that of others, were intended to elicit not intellectual despair but rather intellectual humility. The discovery of ignorance was for Socrates the beginning rather than the end of the philosophical task, for only through that discovery could one begin to overcome those received assumptions that obscured the true nature of what it was to be a human being.*

**Humility instead of despair is much less victimhoodian. 

---
Page: 51

*But Socrates refused at every stage of the trial to compromise his principles, and rejected all efforts to escape or modify the consequences of the verdict. He affirmed the rightness of the life he had led, even if his mission to awaken others now brought him death— which he did not fear, but rather welcomed as a portal to eternity.
Cheerfully drinking the poison hemlock, Socrates became an unreluctant martyr to the ideal of philosophy that he had so long championed.*

**Who will be our time's Socrates? He will become the martyr for truth whose sacrifice will be remembered until the next cycle?

---
Page: 49

*By contrast, Socrates argued, if a man does know what is truly good—what is beneficial for him in the deepest sense—then he will naturally and inevitably act in a good manner. Knowing what is good will necessarily cause one to act on that basis, for no man deliberately chooses that which he knows would harm himself. It is only when he mistakes an illusory good for a genuine good that he falls into erroneous conduct. No one ever does wrong knowingly, for it is the very nature of the good that when it is known, it is desired. In this sense, Socrates held, virtue is knowledge. A truly happy life is a life of right action directed according to reason. The key to human happiness, therefore, is the development of a rational moral character.*

**Creating a foundation for morality in yourself is the first step. What are my values? Why are they my values? What are the inconsistencies I have within myself? When all inconsistencies are ironed out, what will remain? What will I believe in? What will I want to fight for? What God will I want to serve? 

---
Page: 53

*In Plato’s Socrates, human thought no longer stood precariously on its own, but had found a confidence and certainty grounded in something more fundamental.
Thus, as dramatically set forth by Plato, the paradoxical denouement of Socrates’s skeptical pursuit of truth was his final arrival at the conception, or vision, of the eternal Ideas—absolute Good, Truth, Beauty, and the rest— in contemplation of which he ended his long philosophical search and fulfilled it.*

**Is this the fundamental difference between western and eastern philosophy? In western philosophy we were able to get to the promised place by explicitly searching for it. In eastern philosophy, the more you search for it the further away you get from it. 

---
Page: 55

*The trial and execution of Socrates by the Athenian democracy left a profound impression on Plato, persuading him of the untrustworthiness of both a rudderless democracy and a standardless philosophy: hence the necessity of an absolute foundation for values if any political or philosophical system was to be successful and wise.*

**If a democracy can kill a man like Socrates, is it really a good system? 

---
Page: 57

*Plato described knowledge of the divine as being implicit in every soul, but forgotten. The soul, immortal, experiences direct and intimate contact with the eternal realities prior to birth, but the postnatal human condition of bodily imprisonment causes the soul to forget the true state of affairs. The goal of philosophy is to free the soul from this deluded condition in which it 41 is deceived by the finite imitation and veiling of the eternal. The philosopher’s task is to “recollect” the transcendent Ideas, to recover a direct knowledge of the true causes and sources of all things.*

**This reminds me of the matrix. Our genetic and cultural programming hides the truth from us. We can awaken and see reality but it's hard. 

---
Page: 57

*The philosopher is literally a “lover of wisdom” and approaches his intellectual task as a romantic quest of universal significance. For Plato, the ultimate reality is not only ethical and rational in nature, but also aesthetic. The Good, the True, and the Beautiful are effectively united in the supreme creative principle, at once commanding moral affirmation, intellectual allegiance, and aesthetic surrender. As the most accessible of the Forms, visible in part even to the physical eye, Beauty opens up human awareness to the existence of the other Forms, drawing the philosopher toward the beatific vision and knowledge of the True and the Good. Hence Plato suggested that the highest philosophical vision is possible only to one with the temperament of a lover.
The philosopher must permit himself to be inwardly grasped by the most sublime form of Eros—that universal passion to restore a former unity, to overcome the separation from the divine and become one with it.*

**I think we have to work hard to separate culturally constructed beauty from natural beauty. Beauty that cuts through all bullshit, the kind of beauty that we can see in art when it's truly honest, that's the kind of beauty that in science and ethics can guide us towards truth. 

---
Page: 58

*When speaking of this higher reality, Plato repeatedly linked light, truth, and goodness. In the Republic, he described the Idea of the Good as being to the intelligible realm what the Sun is to the visible realm: in the same way that the Sun allows objects of the visible world to grow and to be visible, so does the Good grant to all objects of reason their existence and their intelligibility. The philosopher’s attainment of virtue consists in his discovering that luminous knowledge which brings harmony between the human soul and the cosmic order of archetypes, an order governed and illuminated by the supreme Idea of the Good.*

**Are goodness and complexity related? 

---
Page: 59

*Such passionately affirmed confidence in the reality of the eternal, 43 accompanied by the dialogues’ frequent references to myth and the sacred mysteries, suggests that Socrates and Plato themselves may have been intimately involved with the Greek mystery religions. In the Platonic vision, not only did the divine exist, as in traditional Greek public religion, but through the philosophical path the human soul could attain knowledge of its own divine immortality.*

**In some sense it doesn't need to be a religious God they are referring to. It could be a conceptual God. One who simply represents the good, the true and the beautiful. The concept of something that is beyond yourself.

*Heraclitus associated the Logos with the element of fire, which, like the Heraclitean world as a whole, is born of strife, ever-consuming, and in constant movement. It is the law of the universal Logos that everything is defined by, tends toward, and is ultimately balanced by its opposite, so that all opposites ultimately constitute a unity. The finest harmony is composed of elements that are in tension with each other. Heraclitus asserted that most human beings, by not understanding the Logos, live as if asleep in a false dream of the world, and consequently in a state of constant disharmony. Human beings should seek to comprehend the Logos of life, and thereby awaken to a life of intelligent cooperation with the universe’s deeper order.*

**It's the tension of opposites that create harmony. I think it's the harmony that makes me find certain works of art more pleasing than others.

*As restated by Plato, to discover kosmos in the world was to reveal kosmos in one’s own soul. In the thought life of man, the world spirit revealed itself. Here the Socratic dictum “Know thyself” was seen not as the creed of an introspective subjectivist, but as a directive to universal understanding.*

**The divine intelligence of the universe is discovered within our own intellect. 

---
Page: 66

*The celestial realm seemed to express—indeed it seemed to be—the very image of transcendence. Perhaps because the heavens were distinguished by these extraordinary qualities—luminous appearance, timeless order, transcendent location, terrestrial effects, and an all-encompassing majesty—the ancients viewed the celestial realm as the residence of the gods. The starry sky reigned above as an eternal revolving illustration of the mythic deities, their visible incarnation. From this perspective, the heavens were not so much a metaphor for the divine, but rather the divine’s very embodiment.*

**It's very natural to ascertain divinity in it. Given what they could know at that time. Even now we are in awe of it, though now we're trying to conquer it. As we go further out, we'll have more to awe.

---
Page: 71

*The Ideas could be known most directly through an intuitive leap of immediate apprehension, which was also considered to be a recollection of the immortal soul’s prior knowledge.
The logical necessity of the Ideas could also be discovered by meticulous intellectual analysis of the world of empirical experience, both through dialectic and through mathematics. In addition, the transcendent reality could be encountered through the astronomical contemplation and understanding of the heavens, which displayed the moving geometry of the visible gods. The transcendent could also be approached through myth and the poetic imagination, as well as by attending to a kind of aesthetic resonance within the psyche touched off by the presence of the archetypal in veiled form within the phenomenal world. Thus intuition, memory, aesthetics, imagination, logic, mathematics, and empirical observation each played a specific role in Plato’s epistemology, as did spiritual desire and 55 moral virtue.*

**The idea that knowledge is generated by conjecture overlaps well with intuitively recollecting the ideal forms. 

**I think if Plato had known about the world of particles and atoms, then they too would have been a display of the divine. 

---
Page: 71

*Here, then, we find many of the most characteristic elements of Platonic philosophy: the search for and belief in the absolute and unitary over the relative and diverse, the divinization of order and the rejection of disorder, the tension between empirical observation and ideal Forms, the consequently ambivalent attitude toward empiricism as something to be employed only to be overcome, the juxtaposition of the primordial mythic deities with the mathematical and rational Forms, the further juxtaposition of the many gods (the celestial deities) with the single God (the Creator and supreme Intelligence), the religious significance of scientific research, and finally the complex and even antithetical consequences which Plato’s thought would hold for later developments in Western culture.*

**His foundation led him to not accept what seemed to be the case. The faith was in the universe being knowable or not. Had it not been knowable then all science would be useless. He had to take a leap of faith because the alternative would've  been too sad. 

---
Page: 75

*By replacing Plato’s Ideas with universals, common qualities that the mind could grasp in the empirical world but that did not exist independently of that world, Aristotle turned Plato’s ontology upside down. For Plato, the particular was less real, a derivative of the universal; for Aristotle, the universal was less real, a derivative of the particular. Universals were necessary for knowledge, but they did not exist as self-subsistent entities in a transcendent realm. Plato’s Ideas were for Aristotle an unnecessary idealist duplication of the real world of everyday experience, and a logical error.*

**What new explanatory powers were gained from this change of perspective? 

---
Page: 76

*For in Aristotle’s view, form gives to a substance not only its essential structure but also its developmental dynamic. Organic biology, rather than abstract mathematics, was Aristotle’s characteristic science, and in lieu of Plato’s static ideal reality Aristotle brought a more pronounced recognition of nature’s processes of growth and development, with each organism striving to move from imperfection to perfection: from a state of potentiality to a state of actuality, or realization of its form. While Plato emphasized the imperfection of all natural things compared with the Forms they imitated, Aristotle taught that an organism moves from an imperfect or immature condition in a teleological development toward achievement of a full maturity in which its inherent form is actualized: the seed is transformed into a plant, the embryo becomes the child, the child becomes the adult, and so on. The form is an intrinsic principle of operation that is implicit in the organism from the latter’s inception, as the form of the oak is implicit in the acorn. The organism is drawn forward by the form from potentiality to actuality. After this formal realization is achieved, decay sets in as the form gradually “loses its hold.” The Aristotelian form bestows an indwelling impulse in each organism which orders and motivates its development.*

**Dynamics, processes and empiricism. They are not mutually exclusive with the world proposed by Plato that's more mechanical and perfect, they are complementary. 

**Does Aristotle think anything about the interplay between potentialities and actualities of different things? Potentiality would be affected if something in the environment was lacking or disturbing the things development. 

---
Page: 75

*Plato had taught that things like “whiteness” and “tallness” possessed an existence independent of any concrete things in which they might appear, but for Aristotle that doctrine was untenable. The error, he held, lay in Plato’s confusion of categories, whereby he treated a quality, for example, as a substance. Many things can be beautiful, but that does not mean there is a transcendent Idea of the Beautiful. Beauty exists only if at some point a concrete substance is beautiful. The individual man Socrates is primary, while his “humanness” or “goodness” exists only to the extent that it is found in the concrete particular Socrates. In contrast to the primary reality of a substance, a quality is only an abstraction—though it is not merely a mental abstraction, for it is based on a real aspect of the substance in which it resides.*

**In some sense it feels like Aristotle is interpreting Plato too literally, and that Plato in some sense overstretched his mysticism into reductionist conclusions. 

---
Page: 78

*Establishing systematic rules for the proper employment of logic and language, Aristotle built on principles already worked out by Socrates and Plato, but brought new clarity, coherence, and innovations of his own. Deduction and induction, the syllogism, the analysis of causation into material, efficient, formal, and final causes, basic distinctions such as subject-predicate, essential-accidental, matter-form, potential-actual, universal-particular, genus-species-individual, the ten categories of substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, and affection: all were defined by Aristotle and established thereafter as indispensable instruments of analysis for the Western mind. Where Plato had placed direct intuition of the transcendent Ideas as the foundation of knowledge, Aristotle now placed empiricism and logic.*

**These tools of analysis are great for things that are amenable to analysis. I wouldn't say that creativity is for example, it's more related to the unspeakable. 

---
Page: 80

*Cognition takes place when the mind receives the form of a substance into itself, even though in the world that form never exists apart from its particular material embodiment. The mind conceptually separates, or abstracts, what is not separated in reality. Yet because reality possesses inherent structure, cognition is possible. An empirical approach to nature is meaningful because of nature’s intrinsic openness to rational description, by which it can be cognitively organized according to forms, categories, causes, genera, species, and the like. Thus Aristotle continued and brought new definition to the Platonic conception of an ordered and humanly knowable cosmos.*

**Why do certain substances aspire to certain forms? 

**Aristotle seems to recognize the impossibility of describing reality perfectly, but that it's at least possible to start to describe it abstractly. 

---
Page: 79

*The soul is the form of the body, just as the body is the matter of the soul.*

**The body tries to pattern itself to the soul. The soul is built from the body. Hardware and software have a circular dependency. 

---
Page: 81

*Every being is moved from potentiality to actuality according to an inner dynamic dictated by a specific form. No potentiality is brought into actuality unless there exists an already actual being, a being that has already realized its form: a seed must have been produced by a mature plant, as a child must have a parent. Hence the dynamism and structured development of any entity requires an external cause—a being that serves simultaneously as efficient cause (initiating the motion), formal cause (giving the entity form), and final cause (serving as goal of the entity’s development).*

**What's the difference between the formal cause and the final cause? 

---
Page: 81

*Aristotle’s logic could be represented in the following way: (a) All motion is the result of the dynamism impelling potentiality to formal realization, (b) Since the universe as a whole is involved in motion, and since nothing moves without an impulse toward form, the universe must be moved by a supreme, universal form, (c) Since the highest form must already be perfectly realized—i.e., not in a potential state—and since matter is by definition the state of potentiality, the highest form is both entirely immaterial and without motion: hence the Unmoved Mover, the supreme perfect Being that is pure form, God.*

**Will God be perfection? Will it not be messy? Why must the highest form be fully realized?

---
Page: 87

*In Aristotle and Plato together, then, we find a certain elegant balance and tension between empirical analysis and spiritual intuition, a dynamic beautifully rendered in Raphael’s Renaissance masterpiece The School of Athens. There, in the center of the many Greek philosophers and scientists gathered in lively discussion, stand the elder Plato and the younger Aristotle, with Plato pointing upward to the heavens, to the invisible and transcendent, while Aristotle motions his hand outward and down to the earth, to the visible and immanent.*

**It's only together that they see it all.

Page: 85

*For Plato, a person could properly direct his actions only if he knew the transcendent basis of any virtue, and only the philosopher who had attained knowledge of that absolute reality would be capable of judging the virtue of any action. Without the existence of an absolute Good, morality would have no certain basis, and so for Plato ethics was derived from metaphysics. For Aristotle, however, the two fields were of fundamentally different character. What actually existed was not an Idea of the Good relevant to all situations, but only good persons or good actions in many varying contexts. One could not attain absolute knowledge in ethical matters as one could in scientific philosophy. Morality lay in the realm of the contingent. The best one could do would be to derive rules empirically for ethical conduct that held probable value in meeting the complexities of human existence.
The proper aim in ethics was not to determine the nature of absolute virtue, but to be a virtuous person. That task was necessarily complex and 69 ambiguous, evading final definition, and required practical solutions to specific problems rather than absolute principles that were universally true.
For Aristotle, the goal of human life was happiness, the necessary precondition for which was virtue. But virtue itself had to be defined in terms of rational choice in a concrete situation, where virtue lay in the mean between two extremes. Good is always a balance between two opposite evils, the midpoint between excess and defect: temperance is a mean between austerity and indulgence, courage a mean between cowardice and foolhardiness, proper pride a mean between arrogance and abasement, and so forth. Such a mean can be found only in practice, in individual cases relative to their specific conditions.*

**Their different viewpoints on ethics exemplifies their difference in fundamentals very well. When it comes to ethics we can see examples where both models of reality breed good explanations. Over the long arc of history ethics has moved in one direction, pointing towards there being a universal good. Getting there however requires working through a lot of very specific and concrete problems.

*As planned by Alexander, the large cosmopolitan cities of the empire— above all Alexandria, which he founded in Egypt—became vital centers of cultural learning, in whose libraries and academies the classical Greek inheritance survived and flourished. Alexander seems also to have been inspired by a vision of mankind’s universal kinship beyond all political divisions, and he attempted to bring about such a unity, a massive cultural fusion, by means of his immense military ambition.*

**Was he a force of good? What kind of vision and ambition do you need to successfully conquer most of the world? If the world would be conquered by a benevolent force, would it turn the world into a better place? We kind of have that with the US, but it's clear that the world is to diverse to be happy with that.

*Happiness in this life can best be achieved through withdrawal from the world of affairs to cultivate a quiet existence of simple pleasure in the company of friends. The physical cosmology from which the Epicurean system drew was Democritus’s atomism, with material particles forming the substance of the world, including the mortal human soul. Such a cosmology and contemporary human experience were not unrelated, for citizens of the Hellenistic era, deprived of the defined, centered, organically ordered world of the polis—the general character of which was not unlike the Aristotelian cosmos—may well have sensed a certain parallel between their own fate and that of Democritean atoms, moving randomly at the behest of impersonal forces in the centerless void of a disorientingly expanded universe.*

**If you don't have any agency or effect in the world it makes sense to focus on maximizing pleasure.

*Yet Skeptics such as Sextus argued that people who believed they could know reality were subject to constant frustration and unhappiness in life. If they would genuinely suspend judgment, recognizing that their beliefs about reality were not necessarily valid, they would achieve peace of mind. Neither affirming nor denying the possibility of knowledge, they should remain in a state of open-minded equanimity, waiting to see what might emerge.*

**This has eastern philosophy written all over it.

*And yet the austere rationalism of the dominant philosophies left a certain spiritual hunger. That uniquely creative unity of intellect and feeling of earlier times had now bifurcated. In the midst of an 82 extraordinarily sophisticated cultural milieu—busy, urbanized, refined, cosmopolitan—the reflective individual was often without compelling motivation.*

**It feels like our time's spirit is also hungering for something to  give meaning. The domination of rationalism probably led to the domination of religion, which again lost its power with the Renaissance. Now it seems like we're tired of the Renaissance and we're hungering for spirituality. We're also in a similar time as the Romans in the sense that we have a huge influx of diversity everywhere due to the internet.

*Yet when applied, this scheme revealed further minor irregularities, to explain which Ptolemy employed further geometrical devices: eccentrics 85 (circles whose centers were displaced from the center of the Earth), minor epicycles (additional smaller circles that rotated about a major epicycle or deferent), and equants (which further explained variable speeds by positing another point away from the circle’s center about which motion was uniform). Ptolemy’s elaborate model of compound circles was able to give the first systematic quantitative account of all the celestial motions.
Moreover, its versatility, whereby new conflicting observations could be met by adding new geometrical modifications (e.g., adding another epicycle to an epicycle, or an eccentric to an eccentric), gave the model a flexible power that sustained its reign throughout the classical and medieval periods.*

**When a model is flexible enough to be extended for every new edge case found, then it removes the impetus to figure out why it wasn't able to account for the edge case from the get go, leaving you with an inferior explanation of the world for longer than necessary. I wonder how many breakthroughs are being held back by dogmatic beliefs similar to geocentrism.

*The astrological conception of the world closely reflected the essential Greek concept of kosmos itself, the intelligibly ordered patterning and interconnected coherence of the universe, with man an integral part of the whole. In the course of the Hellenistic era, astrology became the one belief system that cut across the boundaries of science, philosophy, and religion, forming a peculiarly unifying element in the otherwise fragmented outlook of the age. Radiating outward from the cultural center of Alexandria, belief in astrology pervaded the Hellenistic world and was embraced alike by Stoic, Platonic, and Aristotelian philosophers, by mathematical astronomers and medical physicians, by Hermetic esotericists and members of the various 87 mystery religions.*

*Man, whose nature is soul-in-body, has potential access to the highest intellectual and spiritual realms, though this is dependent on his liberation from materiality. Man can rise to the consciousness of the World Soul— thereby becoming in actuality what he already is potentially—and thence to the universal Intellect; or he can remain bound to the lower realms. Because all things emanate from the One through the Intellect and the World Soul, and because the human imagination at its highest participates in that primal divinity, man’s rational soul can imaginatively reflect the transcendent 90 Forms and thus, through this insight into the ultimate order of things, move toward its spiritual emancipation. The entire universe exists in a continual outflow from the One into created multiplicity, which is then drawn back to the One—a process of emanation and return always moved by the One’s superfluity of perfection. The philosopher’s task is to overcome the human bondage to the physical realm by moral and intellectual self-discipline and purification, and to turn inward to a gradual ascent back to the Absolute.
The final moment of illumination transcends knowledge in any usual sense, and cannot be defined or described, for it is based on an overcoming of the subject-object dichotomy between the seeker and the goal: it is a consummation of contemplative desire that unites the philosopher with the One.*

**Transcendence, oneness, emptiness and other divine concepts seems to have such a strong hold on humans. Is it because there's a universal truth behind it or is it simply a quirk of our programming. In a sense they all are answers to questions that go beyond our biology, so I don't think it's just genes messing with us.

*With the several important exceptions already cited, the later efforts of Hellenic culture in the classical period appeared to lack the daring 91 intellectual optimism and curiosity that had been characteristic of the earlier Greeks. At least on the surface, Hellenistic civilization seemed remarkable more for its variety than its force, more for its worldly intelligence than its inspired genius, more for its sustaining and elaboration of past cultural achievements than its origination of new ones. Many significant currents were at work, but the whole did not cohere. The cultural outlook was unsettled, alternately skeptical and dogmatic, syncretistic and fragmented.
The highly organized centers of learning seemed to have a discouraging effect on individual genius. Already by the time of Rome’s conquest of Greece in the second century B.C., the Hellenic impulse was fading, displaced by the more Oriental view of human subordination to the overwhelming powers of the supernatural.*

*That it was the Church that established the divine authority of the scriptural canon, and the scriptural canon that established the divine authority of the Church, may appear circuitous, but that symbiotic mutual endorsement, affirmed in faith by the continuing Church community, effectively ruled the formation of the Christian outlook.*

**Part of Christianity's reproductive success may have been this memetic hack that they stumbled upon. They took control of defining the rules of the game, and as dungeon masters they gave themselves total authority. The Greeks seem to have avoided this obvious hack and allowing a more honest and open inquiry which avoided totalitarian religious beliefs to be forced onto the people. As an empire breaks apart there's ample need for a powerful control structure that appeals especially to the people who are usually harder to control, I.e the peasants.

*It was from this complex fusion of racial, political, religious, and philosophical elements that there gradually arose a comprehensive world view common to Western Christendom. Succeeding that of the classical Greeks as the governing vision of the culture, the Christian outlook would inform and inspire the lives and thinking of millions until the modern era—and, for many, continues to do so.*

*Of all the characteristics of the new religion, Christianity’s claims to universality and historical fulfillment were pivotal, and those claims derived 103 from Judaism. The Judaeo-Christian God was not one tribal or polis deity among many, but was the one true supreme God—the Maker of the universe, the Lord of history, the omnipotent and omniscient King of Kings whose unequaled reality and power justly commanded the allegiance of all nations and all mankind. In the history of the people of Israel, that God had entered decisively into the world, spoken his Word through the prophets, and called forth humanity to its divine destiny: what would be born of Israel would have world-historic significance. To the quickly growing numbers of Christians who now proclaimed their message far and wide in the Roman Empire, what was born of Israel was Christianity.*

**Judaism and Christianity are more like reality shows than their predecessors, in the sense that they make claims of actual historical events and that the people are actually part of the divine stories of the God. Combining that with an almighty God who's capricious and totalitarian and you have a recipe for a memetic virus with epic destructive capabilities.

*While the Hellenic sense of history was generally cyclical, the Judaic was decisively linear and progressive, the gradual fulfillment in time of God’s plan for man.5 While Hellenic religious thought tended toward the abstract and analytic, Judaism’s mode was more concrete, dynamic, and apodictic.
And where the Greek conception of God leaned toward the idea of a supreme ruling intelligence, the Judaic conception emphasized that of a supreme ruling will. For the essence of the Judaic faith rested on a burning expectation that God would actively renew his sovereignty over the world in a dramatic transfiguration of human history, and by Jesus’s time this expectation centered on the appearance of a personal messiah. Christianity integrated the two traditions by proclaiming, in effect, that the true and highest divine reality—God the Father and Creator, the Platonic eternal transcendent—had fully penetrated the imperfect and finite world of nature and human history through the flesh-and-blood incarnation of his Son Jesus Christ, the Logos, whose life and death had commenced a liberating reunion of the two previously separate realms—transcendent and mundane, divine and human—and thus a rebirth of the cosmos through man. The world Creator and Logos had broken anew into history with fresh creative power, inaugurating a universal reconciliation. In the transition from Greek philosophy to Christian theology, the transcendent was made immanent, the eternal was made historical, and human history itself was now spiritually significant: “And the Logos became flesh and dwelt among us.”*

*The old 115 rituals and mysteries constituted a widespread impediment to the propagation of the Christian faith and were therefore combated by Christian apologists in terms not unlike those of the skeptical philosophers of classical Athens, but in a new context and with different intent*

*But unlike the mystery religions, Christianity was proclaimed and recognized as the exclusively authentic source of salvation, superseding all previous mysteries and religions, alone bestowing the true knowledge of the universe and a true basis for ethics. Such a claim was decisive in the triumph of Christianity in the late classical world. Only thus were the anxieties of the Hellenistic era, with its conflicting religious and philosophical pluralism, and with its large amorphous cities filled with the rootless and dispossessed, resolved in the new certitudes. Christianity offered mankind a universal home, an enduring community, and a clearly defined way of life, all of which possessed a scriptural and institutional guarantee of cosmic validity.*

**Certainty is a powerful drug.

*Their characters and properties were retained but were now understood and subsumed in the Christian context, as in the figures of Christ (Apollo and 117 Prometheus, for example, as well as Perseus, Orpheus, Dionysus, Hercules, Atlas, Adonis, Eros, Sol, Mithra, Attis, Osiris), God the Father (Zeus, Kronos, Ouranos, Sarapis), the Virgin Mary (Magna Mater, Aphrodite, Artemis, Hera, Rhea, Persephone, Demeter, Gaia, Semele, Isis), the Holy Spirit (Apollo, Dionysus, Orpheus, as well as aspects of the procreative feminine deities), Satan (Pan, Hades, Prometheus, Dionysus), and a host of angels and saints (the conflation of Mars with Michael the archangel, Atlas with Saint Christopher).*

**A well defined migration path for the legacy religions was probably a key factor of success for Christianity.

*Compared with the pagan outlook, the Christian world view was still structured by a transcendent principle, but it was now a decisively monolithic structure, absolutely governed by one God. Among the Greeks, Plato had been one of the most monotheistic, yet even for him “God” and “the gods” were often interchangeable. For Christians, there was no such ambiguity. The transcendent was still primary, as with Plato, but no longer pluralistic. The Ideas were derivative, and the gods anathema.*

**In a shattered society it makes sense to want to remove ambiguity. That's what the wokes are doing. That's what the bitcoiners are doing.

*In the Christian view, human reason might once have been sufficient when, in the paradisiacal state, it still possessed its original resonance with divine intelligence. But after man’s rebellion and fall from grace, his reason was increasingly obscured and the need for revelation became absolute.
Relying on and developing an exclusively human reason was bound to result in dangerous ignorance and error. Indeed, man’s fall itself was caused by his stealing the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, his first and fatal step toward intellectual independence and proud self-reliance, and a moral transgression of God’s exclusive sovereignty. By grasping such knowledge out of the divine order, man had instead been intellectually blinded, and could now be illuminated only by God’s grace. Thus was the secular rationality so esteemed by the Greeks considered of doubtful value 120 for salvation, with empirical observation largely irrelevant except as an aid to moral improvement. In the context of the new order, the simple faith of a child was superior to the abstruse reasonings of a worldly intellectual.
Christian theologians continued to philosophize, to study the ancients, and to debate doctrinal subtleties—but all within the defined boundaries of Christian dogma. All learning was subservient to theology, now the most important of all studies, and theology found its unshakable basis in faith.*

**I wonder if the stories related to intellect were misinterpreted. Maybe they were simply pointing to the futility of reasoning your way to transcendence. But not necessarily meaning that reason itself was useless for worldly matters. Buddhism has a more pluralistic, inclusive and pragmatic approach to how we live our daily lives and what it means to have reached God. 

**Absolutism is dangerous no matter what form it takes.

*With its planetary deities and aura of polytheistic paganism, and with its proneness to a determinism antithetical to both divine grace and human responsibility, astrology was officially condemned by Church councils (with Augustine especially seeing the need for confuting the astrological “mathematicians”), as a result of which it gradually declined despite its occasional theological defenders.*

**The revolt against determinism makes sense in a world washed in a bureaucracy such as the Roman empire.

*God’s will ruled every aspect of the universe. Because miraculous intervention was always possible, the processes of nature were at all times subservient to divine providence rather than to merely natural laws. The scriptural testaments were thus the final and unchanging repository of universal truth, and no subsequent human efforts were going to enhance or modify, let alone revolutionize, that absolute statement. The relationship of the good Christian to God was that of child to father—typically a very young and naive child to the infinitely greater, omniscient and omnipotent Father.*

**Only a world starving for certainty and direction would people accept such absolutism and authoritarianism.

*The human surrender to the divine was the only existential priority. All else was vanity. Martyrdom, the ultimate surrender of the self to God, represented the highest Christian ideal. As Christ was self-giving in the highest degree, so should all Christians strive to be like their Redeemer.
Humility, not pride, was the distinguishing Christian virtue, requisite for salvation. Selflessness in action and thought, devotion to God and service to others: only through such an emptying of self would the power of God’s grace fully enter and transform the soul.*

**Humility is another one of Christianity's good parts.

*For in the person of Jesus Christ, God had reached out from his transcendence and displayed for all time and all humanity his infinite love for his creatures. Here was the basis for a new way of life, grounded in the experience of God’s love, the universality of which created a new community in mankind.*

**So far it seems true that humans are the first creatures to be able to choose to see God or not. We're the first creatures who need to be convinced that God exists.

*In contrast to the Hellenic focus on great heroes and rare philosophers, Christianity universalized salvation, asserting its availability to slaves as well as kings, to simple souls as well as profound thinkers, to the ugly as well as the beautiful, to the sick and suffering as well as the strong and fortunate, even tending to reverse the former hierarchies. In Christ, all divisions of humanity were overcome—barbarian and Greek, Jew and Gentile, master and slave, male and female—all were now as one. The ultimate wisdom and heroism of Christ made redemption possible for all, not just the few: Christ was the Sun, who shone alike on all mankind.
Christianity therefore placed high value on each individual soul as one of God’s children, but in this new context the Greek ideal of the self-determining individual and the heroic genius was diminished in favor of a collective Christian identity. This elevation of the communal self, the human reflection of the Kingdom of Heaven, founded on the shared love of God and faith in Christ’s redemption, encouraged an altruistic sublimation, and at times subjugation, of the individual self in favor of a greater allegiance to the good of others and the will of God. Yet on the other hand, by granting immortality and value to the individual soul, Christianity encouraged the growth of the individual conscience, self-responsibility, and personal autonomy relative to temporal powers—all decisive traits for the formation of the Western character.*

**Democratization of virtue seems like a natural step. Don't we all want to live good lives? Only being able to do it from an intellectual point of view is very excluding. Just give me the mechanical instructions that I'm able to execute and I will said the man incapable of becoming enlightened. 

**Self-responsibility is another good value brought by Christianity.

Page: 140

*In its moral teachings, Christianity brought to the pagan world a new sense of the sanctity of all human life, the spiritual value of the family, the spiritual superiority of self-denial over egoistic fulfillment, of unworldly 124 holiness over worldly ambition, of gentleness and forgiveness over violence and retribution; a condemnation of murder, suicide, the killing of infants, the massacre of prisoners, the degradation of slaves, sexual licentiousness and prostitution, bloody circus spectacles—all in the new awareness of God’s love for humanity, and the moral purity that love required in the human soul. Christian love, whether divine or human, was not so much the realm of Aphrodite, nor even primarily the Eros of the philosophers, but was the love, epitomized in Christ, that expressed itself through sacrifice, suffering, and universal compassion. This Christian ethical ideal of goodness and charity was strongly promulgated and at times widely observed, an ideal certainly not lacking in the moral imperatives of Greek philosophy— particularly in Stoicism, which in several ways anticipated Christian ethics— but now having a more pervasive influence on the mass culture in the Christian era than had Greek philosophical ethics in the classical world.*

**Christianity had first-mover advantage in morality and ethics. 

**A focus on the group, the family and the community is another good one.

*A sacred doctrine had been entrusted to Christians, and fidelity to that trust, as well as the integrity of that doctrine, needed to be maintained at all costs. Eternal salvation was at stake for all humanity.
Safeguarding the faith was thus the first priority in any question of philosophical or religious dialogue; hence that dialogue was often curtailed altogether lest the devil of doubt or unorthodoxy gain a foothold in the vulnerable minds of the faithful.*

**Heaven is such a dangerous proposition because it allows you to justify any action. That's why utilitarianism in its extreme can justify unimaginable horrors as long as the outcome is better on the chose measure.

*The unitive early Christian ideal of becoming one with the resurrected Christ and with the Christian community, and the Hellenic-inspired mystical philosophical union with the divine Logos, receded as explicit religious goals in favor of the more Judaic concept of strict obedience to the will of God—and, by extrapolation, obedience to the decisions of the Church hierarchy. Christ’s suffering and death were here often portrayed as further cause for human guilt, rather than as effecting the removal of that guilt. The crucifixion in its horrific aspect became the dominant image, rather than the resurrection or the two 132 together. The relationship of guilty child to stern father, as in much of the Old Testament, largely overshadowed the happy reconciliation with the divine essence proclaimed in the other side of early Christianity.*

**Sounds like the normal flow of any technology. It starts out democratic and for the people, but as the institutions grow stronger the emphasis switches to more totalitarianism.

*His crucifixion represented the birth pangs of a new humanity and a new cosmos. A process of divine transfiguration had been initiated in both man and nature by Christ’s redemption, here seen as a cosmic event affecting the whole universe. Instead of condemnation of a sinful humanity in a fallen world, there was here a greater emphasis on God’s limitless grace, the Spirit’s presence, the Logos’s love of man and the world, sanctification, deification, and universal rebirth.*

**Were the aliens also saved?

*So fully was Christ’s redemption here viewed as an absolute and positive fulfillment of human history and of all human suffering that Adam’s original sin, the archetypal origin of human alienation and mortality, was paradoxically celebrated as “O felix culpa!” (“O blessed sin!”) in the Easter liturgy. The Fall—man’s primal error bringing the dark knowledge of good and evil, the moral perils of freedom, the experience of alienation and death —was here viewed not so much as an unmitigatedly heinous and tragic disaster, but as an early and, in retrospect, integral part of man’s existential development caused by his infantile lack of discerning awareness, his naive susceptibility to deception. In the misuse of his God-given freedom, choosing to love and elevate himself over God, man had ruined the perfection of creation and divorced himself from the divine unity. Yet it was just through a painfully acute consciousness of this sin that man could now experience the infinite joy of God’s forgiveness and embrace of his lost soul. Through Christ, the primal separation was being healed and the perfection of creation restored on a new and more comprehensive level. Human weakness thus became the occasion for God’s strength. Only from man’s 135 sense of defeat and finitude could he open himself freely to God. And only by man’s fall could God’s inconceivable glory and love fully reveal itself by righting the unrightable. Even God’s apparent wrath could now be understood as a necessary element in his infinite benevolence, and human suffering seen as the necessary prelude to unbounded happiness.1*

**In a much more down to earth way this is the relationship between master and student in certain Zen schools. The student is first drilled to seek answers in dualities and other nonsense until they hit a wall and realize their arrogance. Then they are ready to learn, and at the end the master, who has built himself up as the ultimate challenge, is defeated by the awakened student. 

**It's interesting that man is shown to give birth to dualities. Indeed the Tao precedes dualities.

*Human history was an immense education into divinity, a leading forth of man’s being to God. Indeed, not only was man to be fulfilled in God, but God was to be fulfilled in man, achieving a self-revelation through his realization in human form. For God had chosen man as the vessel of his image, in which his divine essence could be most fully incarnate.*

**I'm not sure if this anthropocentrism will age well. What kind of spirituality does aliens have?

*Here an unprecedented cosmic optimism was asserted. In its physicality and historicity, Christ’s resurrection held forth the promise that everything —all history both of individuals and of mankind, all striving, all mistakes and sins and imperfections, all materiality, the entire drama and reality of Earth —would somehow be swept up and perfected in a final victorious reunion with the infinite Godhead. All that was cruel and absurd would then be made meaningful in the full revelation of Christ, the hidden meaning of creation. Nothing would be left out. The world was not an evil imprisonment, not a dispensable illusion, but the bearer of God’s glory.
History was not an endless cycle of deteriorating stages, but the matrix of humanity’s deification. Through God’s omnipotence, grim Fate itself was miraculously transmuted into benevolent Providence. Human anguish and despair could now find not just respite, but divine fulfillment. The Gates of Paradise, implacably closed at the Fall, had been reopened by Christ. The infiniteness of God’s compassion and power would inevitably conquer, and thereby consummate, the entire universe.*

**Is this fetishicing our shared dream? Is it a proclamation that consciousness is primary?

*Thus John’s Gospel affirmed a present unity of Christ and believer, but at the expense of an implied ontological dualism. Moreover, despite the fundamental Johannine proclamation that “the Logos became flesh,” the sheer magnitude of luminous divinity possessed by the Christ of John’s Gospel—portrayed there in glory as the exalted Lord from the beginning of his ministry—seemed to far transcend the present potentialities of all other human beings, and consequently tended to highlight the spiritual inferiority and darkness of the natural man and the natural world. It would be the Church that would fill that gap, as the numinous representation of Christ’s continuing presence in the world and the vehicle of humanity’s sacramentalization. The Johannine Christ was opened to man’s being in a mystical way: those who obeyed his commandment of love and who knew him as the Son could participate in his unitary relationship with the transcendent Father. But this special relationship was viewed in contrast with the rest of those who were “of the world,” thereby establishing another division—as the Gnostic elite were distinct from the irredeemable majority of mankind, or the enlightened philosopher was distinct from the unenlightened, or, most broadly for the Christian tradition, those within the 142 Church were distinct from everyone outside it. This division sustained and strengthened that tendency throughout the Old and New Testaments to view salvation in terms of an elect minority of believers who alone were dear to God, and who would be gratuitously saved from the masses of a mankind that was by nature opposed to God and destined for damnation.*

**You have your total authority, the church, and you have your ingroup, the Christians and your outgroup everybody else.

*At its root, this understanding reflected a heightened sense of the divisions of existence—between God and man, heaven and earth, good and evil, the faithful and the damned. Here was stressed the corruption to which both man and this world had succumbed and, in consequence, the transcendent divine activity necessary to save human souls. On this scriptural foundation, and on the basis of their own experience of the present world’s negative condition and their own spiritual longing, devout Christians focused their attention more exclusively on the future and the unworldly, in the form either of the promised Second Coming or of a Church-mediated redeemed afterlife. In either case there resulted a pronounced tendency to negate the intrinsic value of the present life, the natural world, and humanity’s status in the divine hierarchy.*

**I imagine that this actually had a pretty positive effect in people's time preference. 

**It's such a stark contract to Zen where the emphasis is more like the earlier Christianity where you're already one with God and the more you try to attain it the further you get from it. And living in the present is seen as virtue and in fact unavoidable since past and future doesn't exist.

*Early Church fathers believed that as Christ would restore the severed relation between man and God, so would he restore that between man and nature, which since the Fall and man’s misuse of freedom had been subject to man’s selfish arrogation.
Christ’s incarnation into and redemption of the world were here seen not just as exclusively spiritual events, but rather as an unparalleled development within temporal materiality and world history, and as representing the spiritual completion of nature—not nature’s antithesis, but its fulfillment. For the Logos, the divine wisdom, had been present in the creation from its beginning. Now Christ had made the implicit divinity of the 150 world explicit. Creation was the ground of redemption, just as birth was the precondition of rebirth. In this view, nature was regarded as God’s noble handiwork and the present locus of his self-revelation, and was thus worthy of reverence and understanding.
But equally characteristic of Christian thinking was an opposing view, especially dominant in later Western Christianity, in which nature was perceived as that which must be overcome to attain spiritual purity. Nature as a whole was corrupt and finite. Only man, the head of creation, was capable of salvation, and in man only his soul was essentially redeemable. In this understanding, man’s soul was in direct conflict with the base instincts of his own biological nature and was endangered by the potential entrapment of carnal pleasures and the material world. Here the physical body was often deplored as the residence of the devil and the occasion of sin.*

**Christianity is so old that it has done many 180s over its lifetime. It's too bad that the view of nature as something good and divine, didn't become the dominant view. If nature is less than divine and there's a heaven, what reason do we have to care for it?

---
Page: 167

*Like Plato’s Socrates, the devout Christian perceived himself as a citizen of the spiritual world, and his relation to the transitory physical realm was that of a stranger and pilgrim. Man had once possessed a blissful divine knowledge but had fallen into dark ignorance, and only the hope of recovering that lost spiritual light motivated the Christian soul while detained in this body and this world. Only when man awakened from the present life would he attain true happiness. Death, as a spiritual 151 liberation, was more highly valued than mundane existence. At best the concrete natural world was an imperfect reflection of and preparation for the higher spiritual kingdom to come. But more likely the mundane world, with its deceptive attractions, its spurious pleasures and debasing arousal of the passions, would pervert the soul and deprive it of its celestial reward.
Hence all human intellectual and moral effort was properly directed toward the spiritual and the afterlife, away from the physical and this life. In all these ways, Platonism gave an emphatic philosophical justification to the potential spirit-matter dualism in Christianity.*

**If you interpret the awakening and death as a purely psychological journey then it is rather insightful. The world that we see through our lens of mundaness is not the kingdom of heaven that we can see when we've dissolved the ego illusion.

*Moreover, to distance itself from the highly sexualized contemporary pagan culture, much of early Christianity stressed the need for a spiritual purity that held little room for nature’s spontaneous instincts, particularly sexuality.*

**Cultural movements always have many traces of counterreactions to its contemporary counterparts. You can probably guess what the world was like by taking the extreme parts of any cultural movement and imagine the opposite extreme.

*Augustine’s self-consciousness as a volitional, responsible moral agent was acute, as was his awareness of the burdens of human freedom—error and guilt, darkness and suffering, severance from God. In a sense, Augustine was the most modern of the ancients: he possessed an existentialist’s self-awareness with his highly developed capacity for introspection and self-confrontation, his concern with memory and consciousness and time, his psychological perspicacity, his doubt and remorse, his sense of the solitary alienation of the human self without God, his intensity of inner conflict, his intellectual skepticism and sophistication. It was Augustine who first wrote that he could doubt everything, but not the fact of the soul’s own experience of doubting, of knowing, willing, and existing—thereby affirming the certain existence of the human ego in the soul. Yet he also affirmed the absolute contingency of that ego on God, without whom it could not exist, let alone be capable of attaining knowledge or fulfillment. For Augustine was also the most medieval of the ancients. His Catholic religiosity, his monolithic predispositions, his otherworldly focus, and his cosmic dualism all foretokened the succeeding age—as did his keen sense of the invisible, of God’s will, of the Mother Church, of miracles, grace, and Providence, of sin, evil, and the demonic. Augustine was a man of paradox and extremes, and his legacy would be of the same character.*

**It's like Christianity was defined by a dopesick person. And someone who was overcome with darkness and remorse.

*Although official Christian doctrine would not always accept Augustine’s more extreme formulations of predestination or his nearly complete denial of any active human role in the process of salvation, the subsequent Christian view of man’s moral corruption and imprisonment was one largely congruent with Augustine’s.
Thus it was that the man who so decisively declared God’s love and liberating presence in his own life also recognized, with a potency that never ceased to permeate the Western Christian tradition, the innate 157 bondage and powerlessness of the human soul as perverted by Original Sin.
From this antithesis arose the necessity for Augustine of a divinely provided means of grace in this world: an authoritative Church structure, within which haven man could satisfy his overriding needs for spiritual guidance, moral discipline, and sacramental grace.*

**He seems to forget that God is a figment of human imagination and thus a tool for humans to save themselves. 

**The idea of the church as the institution of spirituality is very communistic.

*In other essential aspects of Augustine’s thought and the evolving Christian world view—as in the dualism of an omnipotent transcendent God versus the sin-enchained creaturely man, and the need for a doctrinally and morally authoritative religious structure governing the community of chosen believers—it was the Judaic sensibility that dominated. This was particularly visible in the evolution of Christianity’s characteristic attitudes toward God’s moral commandments.*

**The mixing of spirituality and religion is bad. Spirituality is a way to self transcendence whereas religion is a means of controlling groups of people. It defines laws and it delineates between the ingroup and outgroup.

*Augustine’s strong sense of God’s government of history—as in his dramatic scenario of the two invisible societies of the elect and the damned, the city of God and the city of the world, battling throughout creation’s history until the Last Judgment—still reflected the Judaic ethical vision of God’s purposefulness in history.*

**Determinism and a caste system is a recipe for oppression and bad philosophy.

*In Matthew’s Gospel, the Law is made even more strict for Jesus’s followers—requiring purity of intention as well as act, love of the enemy as well as friend, unceasing forgiveness, utter detachment 161 from worldly things—and the demand for unconditional moral integrity is pressed to the full under the urgency of the messianic transition. On the other hand, Jesus’s emphasis was repeatedly on compassion over self-righteousness, and on the inner spirit over the external letter of the law. His demands for heightened, even absolute, moral purity—judging spontaneous thoughts as well as deliberate acts—seemed to presuppose more than human will to achieve such inner goodness, thus opening the way for faith in God’s grace.*

**It feels like Christianity discovered a bug in humans in the form of how far you can take faith.

*A characteristic compromise position, at once employing the admired Greek culture for Christian apologetic purposes and yet keeping distance from it, was presented by Clement of Alexandria in his use of Homer’s Odyssey: Sailing by the island of the Sirens on his way home to Ithaca, Odysseus tied himself to the mast of his ship so he could hear their seductive singing (“have full knowledge”) without succumbing to their temptation and destroying himself on their rocky shores. So too could the mature Christian make his way through the sensual and intellectual enticements of the secular world and pagan culture, having full knowledge of them while tying himself to the cross—the mast of the Church—for spiritual security.*

**A strong moral conviction makes one incorruptible.

*Although on one’s own resources a human being could not find sufficient love within oneself for others, through the Spirit one could know an infinite love embracing all humanity.*

**In a certain sense you need to internalize a feeling of sacredness in the other if you want to care for them. You get this for free with your close friends and family but for others you usually need something more abstract. The more abstract the greater the bandwidth of your compassion.

*In view of these tendencies toward the disruptive and heretical, and mindful of the need to preserve an orderly structure of belief and ritual, the Church came to adopt a generally negative response to self-proclaimed outbursts of the Holy Spirit. The charismatic and irrational expressions of the Spirit—spontaneous spiritual ecstasies, miraculous healings, speaking in tongues, prophecies, new assertions of divine revelation—were increasingly discouraged in favor of more ordered, rational manifestations, such as sermons, organized religious services and rituals, institutional authority, and doctrinal orthodoxy. A fixed canon of specific apostolic writings was carefully selected and permanently established, with no new revelations recognized as God’s infallible Word. The authority of the Holy Spirit, invested by Christ in the original apostles, now passed on in a sacredly established order to the bishops of the Church, with the ultimate authority in the West claimed by the Roman pontiff, the successor to Peter. The notion of the Holy Spirit as a divine principle of revolutionary spiritual power, immanent in the human community and moving it toward deification, diminished in Christian belief in favor of a notion of the Holy Spirit as solely invested in the authority and activities of the institutional Church. The stability and continuity of the Church were thereby maintained, though at the expense of more individualistic forms of religious experience and revolutionary spiritual impulses.*

**Creativity and novelty always tries to find a way. Like weeds. The churches success came in large part because of their skill and persistence in pruning any and all creative expression.
