*The Mom Test:

Talk about their life instead of your idea
Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future
Talk less and listen more

It’s called The Mom Test because it leads to questions that even your mom can’t lie to you about. When you do it right, they won’t even know you have an idea. There are some other important tools and tricks that we’ll introduce throughout the rest of the book. But first, let’s let’s put The Mom Test to work on some questions.

Rule of thumb: Customer conversations are bad by default. It’s your job to fix them.*

**What you're looking for is insight, not validation. You should be curious about the world and others, not seek confirmation. 

**How do you do follow-up questions without leading them too much? How do I avoid making assumptions that make me miss asking relevant questions? 

---
Page: 19

*Rule of thumb: Opinions are worthless*

**And sometimes even harmful if they make you go in the wrong direction. 

---
Page: 20

*How to fix it: Just like the others, fix it by asking about their life as it already is. How much does the problem cost them? How much do they currently pay to solve it? How big is the budget they’ve allocated? I hope you’re noticing a trend here.*

**What are people spending their money on? It'd be interesting to do a full inventory of the person's spendings, because then you know what problems they pay money to fix and how much. What problems do they have day to day that's making them miserable?

---
Page: 20

*Rule of thumb: People know what their problems are, but they don’t know how to solve those problems.*

**The problems is what you're looking for because each problem may have many solutions. Also look for general trends in their entire set of problems. Is there a problem nexus that will solve a lot of their problems with one solution? 

---
Page: 21

*Rule of thumb: You're shooting blind until you understand their goals.*

**Get the why of their behavior. 

---
Page: 21

*Rule of thumb: Some problems don’t actually matter.*

**Ask questions that reveal why things materially matter to people. Sometimes they're very emotional about something but don't actually care about solving it. Ask what are the implications of what they're doing. 

---
Page: 22

*Rule of thumb: Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are.*

**Things that people use everyday ends up in their implicit memory. They no longer think about how they actually do stuff so they may have a hard time recalling what they do. Observe them, watch out for anything that seems more annoying than it should be. Also ask questions related to why they're doing it that way. What are the constraints? What are the implications? How does it fit in with other stuff? Who do you need to collaborate with?

---
Page: 23

*Rule of thumb: If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours.*

**When people have tried but failed to solve their problems in a satisfactory manner, that's proof that they're willing to take action. 

---
Page: 23

*Common wisdom is that you price your product in terms of value to the customer rather than cost to you. That's true. And you can't quantify the value received without prodding their financial worldview.

Another way to fix it, if you’re far enough along, is to literally ask for money. If you have the deposit or pre-order in hand, you know they were telling the truth.*

**To see the truth in terms of how much someone values something you have to see what they pay without being asked. I suppose looking into similar products is a starting point too. 

---
Page: 24

*"Where does the money come from?"
Good question. This isn't something you would necessarily ask a consumer (though you might), but in a B2B context it’s a must-ask. It leads to a conversation about whose budget the purchase will come from and who else within their company holds the power to torpedo the deal. 

Often, you'll find yourself talking to someone other than the budget owner. Your future pitches will hit unseen snags unless you learn who else matters and what they care about. This knowledge of their purchasing process will eventually turn into a repeatable sales roadmap.*

**Knowing who's making the decisions is key to any kind of negotiation. 

---
Page: 25

*Rule of thumb: People want to help you, but will rarely do so unless you give them an excuse to do so.*

**Be inviting and open, then people may surprise you with the help they're willing to offer. 

---
Page: 26

*you aren’t allowed to tell them what their problem is, and in return, they aren’t allowed to tell you what to build. They own the problem, you own the solution.*

**Thinking of the customer as the problem owner, puts you in the right mindset. 

---
Page: 29

*Bad data gives us false negatives (thinking the idea is dead when it’s not) and—more dangerously—false positives (convincing yourself you’re right when you’re not).*

**We want true negatives and true positives, only. How do we verify when we're not certain? We'd have to collect more data, but if there's a systematic error in the way we do that we can't solve it that way. We have to reason about our data collection process and then collect data.

---
Page: 32

*Remember though: you don’t need to end up with what you wanted to hear in order to have a good conversation. You just need to get to the truth. Here’s a good conversation with a solid negative result.*

**The person who finds the most signal will have an informational advantage or will at least be on par with everybody else at the top. After that it's about putting together a better solution, though that one will depend on more than good data. 

---
Page: 34

*Rule of thumb: Compliments are the fool’s gold of customer learning: shiny, distracting, and entirely worthless.*

**Don't let compliments distract you, in fact take them as a signal that the conversation is going the wrong way. Deflect, ignore and get back to asking proper questions that are about them and what they do, not how great you are. 

---
Page: 34

*Fluff comes in 3 cuddly shapes:

Generic claims (“I usually”, "I always", "I never") 
Future-tense promises (“I would”, "I will")
Hypothetical maybes ("I might", "I could")

When someone starts talking about what they “always” or “usually” or “never” or “would” do, they are giving you generic and hypothetical fluff. Follow The Mom Test and bring them back to specifics in the past. Ask when it last happened, for them to talk you through it, how they solved it, and what else they tried.*

**It's easy to be hypothetical, but the proof is not in the idea world it's in the pudding. As soon as you feel fluff, start anchoring. Although you could start fluffy just to get a starting point but it's important to bring it down and not leave it in the idea world. 

---
Page: 42

*Questions to dig into feature requests:

“Why do you want that?”
“What would that let you do?”
“How are you coping without it?”
“Do you think we should push back the launch add that feature, or is it something we could add later?”
How would that fit into your day?*

**When the customer has an idea they might really be on to something and it's clear that they're motivated to help solve a problem. However you need to know everything about why they're proposing their idea, not just take it at face value. It's very easy for complete misunderstandings to creep in, smoke out all possibilities for that. 

---
Page: 42

*Questions to dig into emotional signals:
“Tell me more about that.”
“That seems to really bug you — I bet there’s a story here.”
“What makes it so awful?”
“Why haven’t you been able to fix this already?”
“You seem pretty excited about that — it’s a big deal?”
“Why so happy?”
“Go on.”

These nudges don’t need to be complicated. People love talking about their opinions and emotions. Digging into a signal is basically just giving them permission to do a brain dump.*

**Understanding the motivation of people will help you not only solving their problem but do it in a way that delights them. You'll be able to get a more holistic view of their relationship with the problem and the world in general. 

---
Page: 44

*Symptoms of The Pathos Problem:

“So here’s that top-secret project I quit my job for... what do you think?”
“I can take it — be honest and tell me what you really think!”

To deal with The Pathos Problem, keep the conversation focused on the other person and ask about specific, concrete cases and examples. Once someone detects that your ego is on the line, they’ll give you fluffy mis-truths and extra compliments. Disregard that data and use The Mom Test to re-focus on the person, their life, and their goals. People rarely lie about specific stuff that’s already happened, regardless of your ego.*

**I'm guilty of asking people not to pull their punches. They'll try to but even subconsciously they will anyway. Talk in a way where it's easy to talk truthfully. Whenever emotions get involved people get more delicate. Ask about concrete things that have happened, that'll activate a part of their brain that doesn't need to care about being delicate. 

---
Page: 44

*Rule of thumb: If you’ve mentioned your idea, people will try to protect your feelings.*

**Try every conversation not to mention your idea. If you mention it at the start you'll have created an anchor for every subsequent thought of theirs. 

---
Page: 45

*Once you start talking about your idea, they stop talking about their problems. Cut yourself off and say something like:

“Whoops—I just slipped into pitch mode. I’m really sorry about that—I get excited about these things. Can we jump back to what you were just saying? You were telling me that…"

If they say they really want to hear about what you’re working on, promise that you’ll tell them at the end of the meeting or loop them in for an early demo, and that you just want to talk a bit more about their stuff before biasing them with your idea.
Rule of thumb: Anyone will say your idea is great if you’re annoying enough about it.*

**Make the best of the situation. Know when you need to pitch and when you need to listen and learn. 

---
Page: 46

*For example, they’ll mention how important security is, and you’ll want to cut in and tell them you’ve thought about all that already. This is also a mistake.

In both cases, the listener was about to give you a privileged glimpse into their mental model of the world. Losing that learning is a shame. You’ll have the chance to fill them in later. Plus, it’s annoying to people if they start trying to help you and you cut them off to correct them.

Rule of thumb: The more you’re talking, the worse you’re doing.*

**When a perfect response pops up in your mind it's really hard to resist the urge of throwing it out there. Stay focused, be mindful and remember that there's no rush throwing your ideas out there. You're there to learn as much as you possibly can about them and their needs, not pitch them your solution. 

---
Page: 49

*In addition to ensuring that you aren’t asking trivialities, you also need to look for the world-rocking scary questions you’re shrinking from. The best way to find them is to run thought experiments. Imagine that the company has failed and ask why that happened. Then imagine it as a huge success and ask what had to be true to get there. Find ways to learn about those critical pieces.

You can tell it’s an important question when the answer to it could completely change (or disprove) your business. If you get an unexpected answer to a question and it doesn’t affect what you’re doing, it wasn’t a terribly important question.

Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking a question which has the potential to completely destroy your currently imagined business.*

**If you get even the slightest fear when thinking about asking something, you know that you absolutely must ask it. The more rigorous you can be in scrutinizing foundational assumptions, what survives will be strong. 

---
Page: 49

*There’s no easy solution to making yourself face and ask these questions. I once heard the general life advice that, for unpleasant tasks, you should imagine what you would have someone else do if you were delegating it. Then do that.*

**You could also think about internalizing the sage. Enhance your perspectival knowing, reduce your egocentrism. 

---
Page: 51

*You’re searching for the truth, not trying to be right. And you want to do it as quickly and cheaply as possible. Learning that your beliefs are wrong is frustrating, but it’s progress. It’s bringing you ever closer to the truth of a real problem and a good market.

The worst thing you can do is ignore the bad news while searching for some tiny grain of validation to celebrate. You want the truth, not a gold star.*

**Do you care about solving problems or looking good? You have to start loving the problem-solving. You should eventually not have to think about truthseeking over approval seeking, truthseeking should become second nature.

---
Page: 52

*Rule of thumb: There’s more reliable information in a “meh” than a “Wow!” You can’t build a business on a lukewarm response.*

**You can dig deeper to understand what's behind the lukewarm response but you should never try to convince them, then you're at best getting a false positive instead of a solid true negative. 

---
Page: 53

*You: “What would you say your biggest problem with going to the gym is?” This is where the conversation goes horribly wrong. Instead of figuring out whether staying fit is actually a real problem, we’re prematurely zooming in on it. Any response we get is going to be dangerously misleading.*

**Zooming in on an unimportant problem will give signal about something that doesn't matter. Wait with zooming in until you find something that matters to the person.

---
Page: 58

*“Does-this-problem-matter” questions:

“How seriously do you take your blog?” 
“Do you make money from it?”
“Have you tried making more money from it?”
“How much time do you spend on it each week?”
“Do you have any major aspirations for your blog?”
“Which tools and services do you use for it?”
“What are you already doing to improve this?”
“What are the 3 big things you’re trying to fix or improve right now?”*

**Asking people directly if the problem matters isn't good enough. Look for unambiguous behavior instead. 

---
Page: 63

*Video games are pure product risk. What sort of question could you ask to validate your game idea? “Do you like having fun?” “Would you like to have even more fun?” Practically 100% of the risk is in the product and almost none is in the customer. You know people buy games. If yours is good and you can find a way to make them notice it, they’ll buy it. You don’t need to rediscover people’s desire to play video games.*

**So how do you validate product risk? I suppose here's where prototyping and iterations are the key part. If it's some new invention you may need to fail a thousand times before you discover the solution. Build the most powerful framework for iteration you can so that you can generate many iterations and capture as much learning from each as possible. 

---
Page: 64

*Rule of thumb: You always need a list of your 3 big questions.*

**Which are the most salient failure points for you right now? What makes you most afraid? What do you honestly think could be the death of your idea?

---
Page: 68

*Rule of thumb: Learning about a customer and their problems works better as a quick and casual chat than a long, formal meeting.*

**Where do you find people to have casual chats with? Meetups, conferences, collaborative settings like workplaces, schools. Forums maybe?

---
Page: 70

*Rule of thumb: If it feels like they’re doing you a favour by talking to you, it’s probably too formal.*

**I find it hard being casual when I have an agenda. How do I fix that? What if I go over the questions and topics that I care about, carefully enough that I know them by heart and then when I go out I instead try to feel genuine interest in the other person and let the conversation flow? Abrupt questions that are obviously poking for information makes conversations stiff. 

---
Page: 69

*Being too formal is a crutch we use to deal with an admittedly ambiguous and awkward situation. Instead of leaving wiggle room for the unexpected, everything becomes a process.*

**I think that the pain of the awkwardness overshadows any interest that I have in the other person. That has to go.

---
Page: 77

*Rule of thumb: “Customers” who keep being friendly but aren’t ever going to buy are a particularly dangerous source of mixed signals.*

**Get them to commit or reject us so we can move on. 

---
Page: 78

*Rule of thumb: If you don’t know what happens next after a product or sales meeting, the meeting was pointless.*

**Next steps should be clear in your mind before going into the meeting. Make sure to explicitly get commits to those steps or a rejection. A rejection doesn't exclude the option of another chance but it gives you a strong signal that there isn't a fit. 

---
Page: 78

*A time commitment could include: 

Clear next meeting with known goals
Sitting down to give feedback on wireframes
Using a trial themselves for a non-trivial period

Reputation risk commitments might be: 

Intro to peers or team
Intro to a decision maker (boss, spouse, lawyer)
Giving a public testimonial or case study

Financial commitments are easier to imagine and include:

Letter of intent (non-legal but gentlemanly agreement to purchase)
Pre-order
Deposit*

**Compliments are not commitments. If they're willing to give up some time, reputation or money, they have committed. 

---
Page: 82

*The more specific it is, the more seriously you can take it. For example: who does he want to introduce you to and what does “ready” mean? And why can’t he make the intro now? This isn’t about being pushy. You don’t have manifest destiny over his rolodex. But you do need to distinguish between legitimate offers and polite gesturing. Knowing what “ready” means can also give you a better sense of what your short-term goals should be.*

**Fluffiness is countered by making it concrete. Push the person in a way that he can be honest about why he doesn't want to commit. 

---
Page: 84

*But don't be annoying. You aren't trying to strong-arm folks into handing over their wallet. You are trying to cut through some of the polite rejections and find out if they're actually going to become a partner/investor/customer.

If they aren't excited, then good news: you got the information you came for. Assimilate it, decide if it matters enough to change your strategy, and then keep on keeping on.*

**If you're fine with a rejection I think it'll be easier to push without being annoying because then you're not coming from a place of vulnerability. 

---
Page: 86

*Have the problem
Know they have the problem
Have the budget to solve the problem
Have already cobbled together their own makeshift solution*

**Look for crucial ductape solutions out there. Either they're solving problems that people care about but there's no other solution for it, or it's a problem they don't care enough about to pay for the existing solutions. If they care about it and if there isn't a solution on the market, there's an opportunity to simply do it better than they did and then sell it to them. 

---
Page: 87

*Rule of thumb: In early stage sales, the real goal is learning. Revenue is just a side-effect.*

**The more insight you get the more you'll be able to embody their situation, and create the best possible solution. It has to be balanced with your needs and other customer's needs though. Find problem nexuses. 

---
Page: 92

*Rule of thumb: If it’s not a formal meeting, you don’t need to make excuses about why you’re there or even mention that you’re starting a business. Just have a good conversation.*

**Be attentive, and look for hooks to grab onto. Have a smooth, natural conversation that digs into their problems. 

---
Page: 92

*Rule of thumb: If it’s a topic you both care about, find an excuse to talk about it. Your idea never needs to enter the equation and you’ll both enjoy the chat.*

**You can come from it from the student angle, you can outright say that you're extremely curious, you can say that you're doing research for a company. Find a good excuse to make it feel alright for the other person to help you out. 

---
Page: 93

*Permanently on the road, everywhere I went was an opportunity to meet new speakers, do favours for event organisers, and learn what they care about. By immersing myself in the community I met a load of people and soon had all the connections and conversations I could handle (I ultimately decided that big speakers and big conferences were a bad customer segment and walked away—not every conversation has to end in finding out your idea is awesome).*

**Dip your toes in the community and see if your preconceived notions about them were correct, or if it turns out they're a better fit than you thought, or not a fit at all. Go in there and learn about them, don't teach them about you. 

---
Page: 93

*I'm skeptical of the quantitative validation of landing page metrics. But they are certainly a great way to collect emails of qualified leads for you to reach out to and strike up a conversation with.

Paul Graham recommends a generic launch for the same purposes. Get your product out there, see who seems to like it most, and then reach out to those users.*

**Email lists in general are very powerful. Though some customer segments will absolutely never subscribe to an email list. 

---
Page: 95

*When you are finding ways to sneak into customer conversations, you're always on the back foot. You made the approach, so they are suspicious and trying to figure out if you're wasting their time. Instead, we can look for ways to separate ourselves from the crowd so they can find us. Beyond saving you vast sums of time and frustration, bringing people to you also makes them take you more seriously and want to help you more. How can you plant a flag your customers can see? What can you offer them that will make them want to talk to you?*

**Organize meetups, speaking and teaching and blogging. They're all ways of putting yourself out there in a way that you seem credible. By stamping yourself as an expert, others will see you as one. 

---
Page: 98

*Warm intros are the goal. Conversations are infinitely easier when you get an intro through a mutual friend that establishes your credibility and reason for being there.*

**You don't need first-person contact with anyone but you need to know some people that are connected to others. Industry experts, university professors, investors and probably a lot other roles make it a big part of their work to be well connected. Use one of those people as a springboard. Be ready to be in service somehow, people will enjoy referring you if they can feel your gratitude. 

**Normal people can also be more connected than you think, make sure you ask, and then ask again. You may need to go through a couple of hops on the graph but eventually you'll hit on someone that knows who you're looking for. 

---
Page: 101

*The framing format I like has 5 key elements.

You're an entrepreneur trying to solve horrible problem X, usher in wonderful vision Y, or fix stagnant industry Z. Don't mention your idea.
Frame expectations by mentioning what stage you're at and, if it's true, that you don't have anything to sell.
Show weakness and give them a chance to help by mentioning your specific problem that you're looking for answers on. This will also clarify that you're not a time waster.
Put them on a pedestal by showing how much they, in particular, can help.
Ask for help.

Or, in shorter form: Vision / Framing / Weakness / Pedestal / Ask*

**The framing sets the tone of the meeting and can help you make it useful. 

---
Page: 102

*People like to help entrepreneurs. But they also hate wasting their time. An opening like this tells them that you know what you need and that they'll be able to make a real difference. 

Once the meeting starts, you have to grab the reins or it's liable to turn into them drilling you on your idea, which is exactly what you don't want.*

**It's about helping them helping you. You need to set the stage for them to make a slamdunk and then be done. 

---
Page: 104

*Setting up a call feels like less overhead in the short-term, but that’s because you aren’t yet able to see all the time-saving and business-saving benefits of in-person relationships with your customers. 

That being said, some other great people in the field like and recommend phone calls. Use whatever works. But I will say that you should start in person. It’s too easy to use surveys or phone calls as an excuse to skip the awkwardness of meeting in person rather than as a considered trade-off.*

**Video calls has for whatever reason not gained a feeling of casualness. 

---
Page: 105

*With that mindset switch, you'll know why you're there. And instead of it being a customer-learning-but-I-really-want-to-do-sales meeting, it's a let-me-find-out-if-you-are-a-good-advisor-by-asking-lots-of-questions meeting.

Willpower is a finite resource. The way to overcome difficult situations isn't to power through, but rather to change your circumstances to require less willpower. Changing the context of the meeting to "looking for advisors" is the equivalent of throwing out all your chocolate when you start a diet. You change the environment to naturally facilitate your goals.

You don't need to explicitly tell them you're looking for advisors. In fact, I wouldn't unless you already quite like them and it happens to come up in conversation. It's really about orienting your state of mind to give you a helpful internal narrative and consistent front.

Somewhat counterintuitively, the sales-advisor switch also puts you firmly in control of the meeting, since you're now evaluating them. Even if the topics of discussion are basically the same, you (and they) will notice the difference.*

**The mindset can completely change the way you think. Put yourself in the most appropriate mindset for the situation. Some mindsets are harder to inhabit than others, but some are quite easy to put on. 

---
Page: 106

*Rule of thumb: Keep having conversations until you stop hearing new stuff.*

**3-5 conversations usually covers it. If you need more, question whether you're solution and problem are too unfocused.

---
Page: 109

*They say that startups don’t starve, they drown. You never have too few options, too few leads, or too few ideas. You have too many. You get overwhelmed. You do a little bit of everything. 

When it comes to avoiding drowning and making faster progress, good customer segmentation is your best friend.*

**How do you select customer segments? It'll always feel like you're missing out on the ones you decides to cut. 

---
Page: 114

*Rule of thumb: If you aren’t finding consistent problems and goals, you don’t yet have a specific enough customer segment.*

**As you learn and more about a problem the resolution becomes higher and higher which allows you to more clearly see differences in audiences. 

---
Page: 110

*When we look at the big successes, they seem to serve the whole world. Google lets anyone find anything. Paypal helps anyone send money anywhere. Evernote backs up all the writing of everybody.

But they didn’t start there. If you start too generic, everything is watered down. Your marketing message is generic. You suffer feature creep. Google helped PhD students find obscure bits of code. EBay helped collectors buy and sell Pez dispensers. Evernote helped moms save and share recipes.

When you have a fuzzy sense of who you’re serving, you end up talking to a lot of different types of people, which leads to confusing signals and three problems:

You get overwhelmed by options and don’t know where to start
You aren’t moving forward but can’t prove yourself wrong
You receive incredibly mixed feedback and can’t make sense of it*

**You need to solve the problem well enough to gain attention. To by very specific about who you solve it for is a way to scope down the problem, to make it easier to solve. The most extreme case, and where you usually start, is doing a custom solution for yourself. 

---
Page: 117

*Since you’ll spend a lot of time talking to your customers, it’s worth choosing someone who is both accessible and fun for you to be around. This stuff is hard work and can be a real grind if you’re cynical about the people or the industry you’re trying to understand and serve.

As we mentioned, you can broaden your segment back out later. Make your life easy for now by choosing someone who is specific and who also and meets the three big criteria of being reachable, profitable, and personally rewarding.*

**It's easy to forget that you can choose customers that you find pleasant to solve problems for. In fact that is probably the  most important one for keeping your integrity in terms of being customer-oriented. 

---
Page: 115

*Start with a broad segment and ask:

Within this group, which type of this person would want it most?
Would everyone within this group buy/use it, or only some of them?
Why do they want it? (e.g. What is their problem or goal)
Does everyone in the group have that motivation or only some of them?
What additional motivations are there?
Which other types of people have these motivations?

We now have a two groups of segments: the first is a collection of quite specific demographic groups and the second is a series of motivations. When we look at them, some will be more generic than others. Go back through the generic ones and keep slicing. Just repeat the questions above. Within that sub-group, who wants it most? Next we’re going to look at our groups’ behaviours and figure out where to find them.

What are these people already doing to achieve their goal or survive their problem?
Where can we find our demographic groups?
Where can we find people doing the above workaround behaviours?*

**The steps to customer slicing are mechanical but the results can spark insight. 

---
Page: 122

*Therefore, owning the customer conversations creates a de-facto dictator with “The customer said so” as the ultimate trump card. 

But as we’ve seen, it’s easy to misinterpret what the customer said.

When all the customer learning is stuck in someone’s head instead of being disseminated to the rest of the team, you’ve got a learning bottleneck. Avoid creating (or being) the bottleneck. To do that, the customer and learning has to be shared with the entire founding team, promptly and faithfully. That relies on good notes plus a bit of pre- and post-meeting work.*

**Getting multiple perspectives on things that are up for interpretation is crucial for error correction.  

---
Page: 125

*“What do we want to learn from these guys?”

In fact, if you’re tight for time, asking this question is the only prep you really need.

Rule of thumb: If you don’t know what you’re trying to learn, you shouldn’t bother having the conversation.*

**You need to know what you don't know. What do you need to learn is how your company might fail and how it might succeed, you need to understand the world from the customer's point of view.

---
Page: 132

*Rule of thumb: Notes are useless if you don't look at them.*

**This is true for notes in general. 

---
Page: 137

*It happens. It’s okay. Review with your team, don’t beat yourself up (or your cofounders) over mistakes. Work on getting better as a team.*

**If I meet people with this mindset I might just want to work with them. 

---
Page: 138

*Having a process is valuable, but don’t get stuck in it. Sometimes you can just pick up the phone and hack through the knot.*

**Be on the lookout for Gordian knots. 

---
Page: 141

*With your team, review your notes and key customer quotes
If relevant, transfer notes into permanent storage
Update your beliefs and plans
Decide on the next 3 big questions*

**Learning as an organization is similar to learning as a person. You need to collect the data in an unbiased manner, and you need to assimilate the data somehow. 

**How should you organize your beliefs about the customer?

---
