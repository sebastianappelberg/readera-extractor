*Humanity’s exodus would proceed in five steps: First, the Earth Engines’ jets would be used to counteract the Earth’s movement, stopping its rotation. Second, the engines’ entire power would be used to set the Earth on a new path, accelerating the Earth into escape velocity, taking it away from the Sun. Third, in outer space, the Earth would continue to accelerate as it traveled to Proxima Centauri. Fourth, in transit, the Earth Engines would be re-aligned, the Earth’s rotation would be restarted and the deceleration process initiated. And then fifth, the Earth would be moored in an orbit around Proxima Centauri, becoming its planet. People also called these five steps the “Reining Age”, the “Exodial Age”, the “First Wandering Age” (during acceleration), the “Second Wandering Age” (during deceleration), and the “New Sun Age”.
The entire exodus would last 2,500 years, about 100 generations.*

**What an interesting way to view a longterm plan. It's as if the Greeks would coin our ages before they came to pass. Middle ages, enlightenment, industrial age, information age, etc.

*I stared at the bubbles, watching the raging waves of color and light play over their surfaces, their twisting turbulences far too complex and intricate for the human mind to take in. I could not shake the thought that the bubbles knew how short their lives would be and were frenziedly revealing the countless dreams and legends of their vast memories to the world. Seconds later, the raging waves of color and light disappeared in a nearly soundless explosion, leaving behind only the tiniest wisp. They remained for less than a second before disappearing; and then there was no trace that anything had ever existed.
“Did you see? The Earth is a cosmic soap bubble; with a pop, it will be nothing. So what is there to be afraid of?” Ling asked.
It was my turn to frown. “It’s not really like that; the calculations show that after the helium flash it will take about a hundred hours before the Earth is fully vaporized.”
“That’s the absolutely terrible part!” she shouted. “We are a third of a mile underground, just like the meat stuffing in a pie. First we’ll be roasted and then we’ll be vaporized!”
For a moment a cold shiver ran down my entire body.
Ling continued. “But it won’t be like that on the surface. There everything will evaporate in the blink of an eye. The people on the surface will be like soap bubbles, gone in a pop.” She smiled again. “And because of that, I think it would be better to be on the surface when the helium flash hits.”*

**I love the likeness between earth and a soap bubble. Cosmically that's how fragile we are.

*Because the Western Hemisphere also faced the Sun, the temperatures there were truly horrific; horrific enough to burn all their vegetation to ash.*

**What's going to happen to all life when there's no sun providing energy?

*The light of the Earth Engines had disappeared together with my fellow racers. By this time I had come upon Earth’s darkest corner. Here all things stretched into infinity; above, the starlit sky, and below, the frozen ocean. It almost seemed as if they reached the ends of the universe; or perhaps I had reached the ends of the universe itself.
I felt as if I was the only human in this cosmos of infinite stars and endless ice, and I was overwhelmed by an avalanche of loneliness. At the edge of tears, I sped on, racing as if my life depended on it. My race was no longer for a spot on the podium; it was to rid myself of this terrible loneliness before it killed me. In my mind there was no longer a far shore for me to reach.*

**When you're surrounded by infinity it must be hard to know whether you're a separate entity or just infinity.

*The dim light before us left me feeling like a deep sea diver finally seeing the light of the surface after a long ascent from the abyss. I began to breathe easy again.*

**It's funny how malleable our conscious experience is.

*The Earth Engines’ blue glow dragged long shadows from the exposed steel skeletons of the city’s skyscrapers as they reached from the Earth like the fossil remains of prehistoric beasts.*

**What if dinosaurs were just moving houses for some ancient virus that was the actual ruler of the planet?

*They were made of solid oxygen and nitrogen; our frozen atmosphere*

**Is that what would happen for real? The atmosphere is cooler than I thought.
